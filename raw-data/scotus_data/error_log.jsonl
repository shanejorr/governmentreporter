OKLAHOMA\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF\n                       OKLAHOMA\n\n  No. 22\u20137466.       Argued October 9, 2024\u2014Decided February 25, 2025\nIn 1997, Justin Sneed beat Barry Van Treese to death with a baseball\n  bat at an Oklahoma hotel owned by Van Treese and managed by peti-\n  tioner Richard Glossip. Glossip initially made inconsistent statements\n  to the police about Sneed\u2019s role in the murder, but he ultimately told\n  police that Sneed admitted to killing Van Treese. Sneed later claimed\n  Glossip had asked him to murder Van Treese because, among other\n  things, Glossip had wanted to steal Van Treese\u2019s money. Glossip main-\n  tained his innocence and refused a plea deal that would have had him\n  avoid the death penalty in return for testifying against Sneed. Sneed\n  then testified against Glossip at trial in exchange for avoiding the\n  death penalty, and Sneed\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence con-\n  necting Glossip to the murder. The jury convicted Glossip and sen-\n  tenced him to death. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n  (OCCA) overturned that conviction because the defense had been inef-\n  fective in challenging Sneed\u2019s testimony and the remainder of the evi-\n  dence only weakly corroborated Sneed\u2019s account. At the retrial, Sneed\n  provided inconsistent testimony on potential motives for Glossip\u2019s\n  murder. Sneed also denied that he had been prescribed lithium or seen\n  a psychiatrist. After the defense established (through the State\u2019s med-\n  ical examiner) that Van Treese had been attacked with a knife as well\n  as a bat, Sneed testified that he had repeatedly tried to stab Van\n  Treese in the chest with a pocket knife. But Sneed had previously de-\n  nied stabbing Van Treese both when questioned by the police as well\n  as at Glossip\u2019s first trial. Glossip moved for a mistrial based on the\n  prosecution\u2019s failure to notify the defense about Sneed\u2019s change in tes-\n  timony, which the trial court denied after the prosecution disclaimed\n  any knowledge about the change. Glossip was again convicted and\n  sentenced to death, and a closely divided OCCA affirmed, holding that\n\f2                         GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    circumstantial evidence suggesting Glossip had mismanaged the hotel,\n    combined with Glossip\u2019s concession that he had been dishonest in his\n    initial statements after the murder, sufficiently corroborated Sneed\u2019s\n    testimony that he killed Van Treese at Glossip\u2019s direction.\n       Glossip subsequently filed several unsuccessful habeas petitions.\n    Concerns over the integrity of his conviction led a bipartisan group of\n    Oklahoma legislators to commission an independent investigation by\n    a law firm, Reed Smith. In June 2022, Reed Smith reported \u201cgrave\n    doubt\u201d about Glossip\u2019s conviction, citing factors such as the prosecu-\n    tion\u2019s deliberate destruction of key evidence and the false portrayal of\n    Justin Sneed as a non-violent \u201cpuppet.\u201d The State then disclosed seven\n    boxes of previously withheld documents, including letters suggesting\n    Sneed had considered recanting and a note from prosecutor Connie\n    Smothermon to Sneed\u2019s lawyer noting they should \u201cget to\u201d Sneed to\n    discuss his problematic testimony about a knife found in Van Treese\u2019s\n    room. Glossip filed for post-conviction relief based on this evidence and\n    evidence revealed by Reed Smith. Glossip also argued that, during his\n    second trial, Smothermon had interfered with Sneed\u2019s testimony about\n    the knife in violation of the rule of sequestration, which prohibits wit-\n    nesses from hearing each other\u2019s testimony. Oklahoma waived any\n    procedural defenses to Glossip\u2019s claims, and asked the OCCA to deny\n    the claims on their merits. The OCCA denied Glossip\u2019s claims as pro-\n    cedurally barred and meritless.\n       The State then discovered additional documents revealing that\n    Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lith-\n    ium, contradicting his trial testimony. The attorney general deter-\n    mined that Smothermon had knowingly elicited false testimony from\n    Sneed and failed to correct it, violating Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264,\n    which held that prosecutors have a constitutional obligation to correct\n    false testimony. Glossip filed a successive petition for post-conviction\n    relief, which the attorney general supported, conceding multiple errors\n    that warranted a new trial. The OCCA denied the unopposed petition\n    without a hearing, holding that Glossip\u2019s claims were procedurally\n    barred under Oklahoma\u2019s Post-Conviction Procedures Act (PCPA), and\n    further that the State\u2019s concession was not \u201cbased in law or fact\u201d be-\n    cause it did not create a Napue error. This Court stayed Glossip\u2019s ex-\n    ecution and granted certiorari.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the OCCA\u2019s judgment. The\n independent and adequate state ground doctrine precludes the Court\n from considering a federal question if the state court\u2019s decision rests\n on an independent and adequate state law ground. OCCA\u2019s applica-\n tion of the PCPA was not such a ground, because the OCCA\u2019s decision\n to apply the PCPA depended on its antecedent rejection of the attorney\n\f                   Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ngeneral\u2019s confession of a Napue error, which was based solely on fed-\neral law. The OCCA held that the confession could not overcome the\nPCPA\u2019s limitations because it lacked a basis in law or fact, specifically\nfinding no Napue error.\n   Oklahoma precedent confirms that the OCCA normally rejects an\nattorney general\u2019s confession of error only after finding it unsupported\nby law and the record. By making the application of the PCPA contin-\ngent on its determination that the attorney general\u2019s confession of fed-\neral constitutional error was baseless, the OCCA made the procedural\nbar dependent on an antecedent ruling on federal law. To the extent\nthat the OCCA\u2019s reasoning on this point is insufficiently \u201cclear from\nthe face of the opinion,\u201d the Court presumes reliance on federal law\nunder Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041.\n   2. The prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct\nfalse testimony.\n      (a) Under Napue, a conviction obtained through the knowing use\nof false evidence violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process\nClause. To establish a Napue violation, a defendant must show that\nthe prosecution knowingly solicited or allowed false testimony to go\nuncorrected. If a violation is established, a new trial is warranted if\nthe false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected\nthe jury\u2019s judgment; meaning, ordinarily, that the prosecution must\nestablish harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v.\nBagley, 473 U. S. 667, 680, n. 9; Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,\n24. Here, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general joins Glossip in asserting a\nNapue error, conceding that Sneed\u2019s testimony about his lithium pre-\nscription was false and that the prosecution knowingly failed to correct\nit. The record supports that confession of error. Evidence showed that\nSneed was prescribed lithium to treat bipolar disorder, not after ask-\ning for cold medicine as he claimed at trial. The evidence likewise es-\ntablishes that the prosecution knew Sneed\u2019s testimony was false. The\nprosecution almost certainly had access to Sneed\u2019s medical file through\nSneed\u2019s competency evaluation. And Smothermon\u2019s notes show that\nshe had a pre-trial conversation with Sneed at which he mentioned\n\u201clithium\u201d and \u201cDr. Trumpet.\u201d The straightforward inference is that\nSmothermon was aware before trial that Sneed had received his lith-\nium prescription from Dr. Trombka, a psychiatrist and the sole medi-\ncal professional at the Oklahoma County jail authorized to prescribe\nlithium.\n   Because Sneed\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence of Glossip\u2019s\nguilt, the jury\u2019s assessment of Sneed\u2019s credibility was material and\nnecessarily determinative. Correcting Sneed\u2019s lie would have under-\nmined his credibility and revealed his willingness to lie under oath.\nThe false testimony also bore on Glossip\u2019s guilt because evidence of\n\f4                        GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Sneed\u2019s bipolar disorder, which could trigger impulsive violence when\n    combined with his drug use, would have contradicted the prosecution\u2019s\n    portrayal of Sneed as harmless without Glossip\u2019s influence. Hence\n    there is a reasonable likelihood that correcting Sneed\u2019s testimony\n    would have affected the judgment of the jury. Napue, 360 U. S., at 271.\n    Additional prosecutorial misconduct, such as violating the rule of se-\n    questration, destroying evidence, and withholding witness statements,\n    further undermines confidence in the verdict. Consequently, the pros-\n    ecution\u2019s failure to correct Sneed\u2019s false testimony entitles Glossip to a\n    new trial under Napue.\n          (b) The OCCA\u2019s contrary holding rests on a mistaken interpreta-\n    tion of Napue. The OCCA held that there was no violation because the\n    defense was aware or should have been aware that Sneed was taking\n    lithium. But Sneed\u2019s false testimony concerned the reasons for his pre-\n    scription, not merely the fact that he had taken lithium. Moreover, the\n    Due Process Clause imposes the duty to correct false testimony on the\n    State, not the defense. The OCCA\u2019s holding that Sneed was likely in\n    denial of his mental health disorders is beside the point; what matters\n    is that the testimony was false and the prosecutor knowingly allowed\n    it to stand.\n       Additional arguments in support of the OCCA\u2019s position are unper-\n    suasive. Napue does not require that the false testimony itself must\n    have directly affected the trial\u2019s outcome; Napue requires assessing\n    whether the prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct the testimony could have\n    contributed to the verdict. Also unpersuasive are arguments based on\n    extra-record materials and insufficient time spent interviewing the\n    prosecutor.\n       Because the attorney general\u2019s confession of error is supported by\n    ample evidence, the Court declines to remand this case for further ev-\n    identiary proceedings. When the Court has jurisdiction, a new trial is\n    the appropriate remedy for a violation of Napue.\n529 P. 3d 218, reversed and remanded.\n\n   SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

At trial, Sneed admitted he beat\nVan Treese to death, but testified that Glossip had offered\nhim thousands of dollars to do so. Glossip confessed he\nhelped Sneed conceal his crime after the fact, but he denied\nany involvement in the murder.\n  Nearly two decades later, the State disclosed eight boxes\nof previously withheld documents from Glossip\u2019s trial.\nThese documents show that Sneed suffered from bipolar\ndisorder, which, combined with his known drug use, could\nhave caused impulsive outbursts of violence. They also es-\ntablished, the State agrees, that a jail psychiatrist pre-\nscribed Sneed lithium to treat that condition, and that the\nprosecution allowed Sneed falsely to testify at trial that he\nhad never seen a psychiatrist. Faced with that evidence,\nOklahoma\u2019s attorney general confessed error. Before the\nOklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA), the State\nconceded that the prosecution\u2019s failure to correct Sneed\u2019s\ntestimony violated Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264 (1959),\n\f2                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich held that prosecutors have a constitutional obliga-\ntion to correct false testimony. The attorney general ac-\ncordingly asked the court to grant Glossip a new trial. The\nOCCA declined to grant relief because, it held, the State\u2019s\nconcession was not \u201cbased in law or fact.\u201d 2023 OK CR 5,\n\u00b625, 529 P. 3d 218, 226. Because the prosecution violated\nits obligations under Napue, we reverse the judgment below\nand remand the case for a new trial.\n                              I\n                              A\n  Barry Van Treese owned a Best Budget Inn in Tulsa and\nin Oklahoma City. Richard Glossip managed the Oklahoma\nCity hotel and lived there with his girlfriend. In the sum-\nmer of 1996, Justin Sneed and his stepbrother approached\nGlossip and asked him about working for a room. 2 App.\n648. Glossip agreed to let them stay in return for help with\nmaintenance and housekeeping. Sneed, however, had a\nhistory of violence, angry outbursts, and substance abuse\nthat included marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, and\nacid. Id., at 700\u2013701. When, on January 6, 1997, Van\nTreese visited the inn to collect cash deposits there, Sneed\nbeat him to death with a baseball bat. See 2007 OK CR 12,\n\u00b6\u00b64\u20135, 157 P. 3d 143, 147\u2013148 (Glossip II ).\n  After killing Van Treese, Sneed evaded law enforcement\nfor several days. Police did promptly interview Glossip,\nwho told them that Sneed had knocked on his door that\nnight with a bump on his head \u201clike somebody punched\nhim.\u201d App. to Response to Petitioner\u2019s Succ.

Glossip\ndisclaimed any knowledge of Van Treese\u2019s murder, but ad-\nmitted that he helped Sneed replace (from the outside) the\nbroken window of the room where Van Treese\u2019s body was\nlater found. The next day, officers arrested Glossip in front\n\f                 Cite as: 604 U.

Glossip then admitted Sneed had\ntold him \u201cthat he killed Barry.\u201d Tr. of Glossip Police Inter-\nview 10 (Jan. 9, 1997). When confronted with his prior in-\nconsistent statements about the murder and Van Treese\u2019s\nwhereabouts, Glossip said that he had been scared to tell\nthe truth because he feared his failure to notify the police\nimmediately meant he was \u201calready involved in it.\u201d Id., at\n29\u201330.\n   The State thereafter charged Sneed with capital murder\nand Glossip as an accessory after the fact based on his in-\naccurate statements to the police. Eventually, police lo-\ncated and interviewed Sneed, who had $1,680 in bloody\ncash on him. See 14 Tr. 18 (May 28, 2004); 15 Tr. 170 (June\n1, 2004). The officers told Sneed that before he \u201cma[de] up\n[his] mind on anything\u201d they wanted him \u201cto hear some of\nthe things\u201d they \u201c[had] to say,\u201d including that they did not\nthink Sneed had acted alone and that he should not \u201ctake\nthe whole thing\u201d himself. 2 App. 645\u2013646. \u201c[E]verybody\u201d\nwas making Sneed \u201cthe scapegoat in this,\u201d they told him\u2014\nespecially Glossip, who was \u201cputting it on [him] the worst.\u201d\nId., at 655.\n   Sneed initially responded to the officers\u2019 prompts by at-\ntempting to implicate his brother, ibid., but eventually said\nthat Glossip had wanted to steal Van Treese\u2019s money and\nthat Van Treese\u2019s death had been the result of a robbery\ngone wrong. Id., at 655\u2013660. Sneed described breaking into\nVan Treese\u2019s room and beating him with a baseball bat un-\ntil he \u201cfigured he was knocked out.\u201d Id., at 665. According\nto Sneed, he then took Van Treese\u2019s car keys, stole an enve-\nlope with approximately $4,000 in cash from his car, and\nsplit the money with Glossip. Id., at 665\u2013669. When offic-\ners pressed him on the state of Van Treese\u2019s body, Sneed\nasserted that, \u201c[a]ctually,\u201d Glossip had asked him to kill\nVan Treese so that he \u201ccould run the motel without him be-\ning the boss.\u201d Id., at 675.\n\f4                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Following Sneed\u2019s interview, Oklahoma charged Glossip,\ntoo, with capital murder. The prosecution offered Glossip a\ndeal: plead guilty and avoid the death sentence in return\nfor testifying against Sneed. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 22\u20136500, p. 144a. When Glossip refused, maintaining\nhis innocence, the State offered Sneed the same deal, and\nSneed accepted. 2001 OK CR 21, \u00b65, 29 P. 3d 597, 599\n(Glossip I ). Sneed then testified at Glossip\u2019s trial that he\nbeat Van Treese to death \u201cbecause [Glossip] asked him to\ndo it.\u201d Ibid. When asked whether there was \u201cany particular\nreason why Glossip wanted to kill [Van Treese] that night,\u201d\nSneed replied, \u201cNot that I know of. Every time that Mr.\nVan Treese showed up, [Glossip] was wanting me to kill\nhim.\u201d 6 Tr. 89 (June 8, 1998). In closing, the prosecution\nargued that Glossip had asked Sneed to kill Van Treese be-\ncause he believed Van Treese planned to fire him for em-\nbezzling hotel profits. 8 Tr. 14\u201315 (June 10, 1998). The jury\nconvicted Glossip and sentenced him to death.\n   The OCCA unanimously reversed. Sneed\u2019s testimony\nwas the only direct evidence connecting Glossip to the mur-\nder, it held, and \u201c[t]he evidence at trial tending to corrobo-\nrate Sneed\u2019s testimony was extremely weak.\u201d Glossip I, 29\nP. 3d, at 599. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine\nSneed on his many inconsistent statements was therefore\n\u201cso ineffective\u201d as to undermine any \u201cconfidence that a reli-\nable adversarial proceeding took place.\u201d Ibid.\n   In 2004, after Glossip rejected another plea offer, 3 App.\n720, the State tried him a second time. Several witnesses\nconfirmed what Glossip had told the police in his second in-\nterview: In the hours following Van Treese\u2019s killing, Glossip\nfeigned ignorance and lied about Van Treese\u2019s whereabouts.\nAs in the first trial, however, only one witness, Justin\nSneed, testified that Glossip was involved in anything\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U.

Although Sneed had denied stabbing Van Treese\nto the police and at Glossip\u2019s first trial, he now said that he\nhad repeatedly tried to stab Van Treese in the chest with a\npocket knife. Glossip II, 157 P. 3d, at 148\u2013149. Because\nthe prosecution had not notified the defense about this\nchange in testimony, Glossip moved for a mistrial. 12 Tr.\n105 (May 26, 2004).

Id., at 107\u2013108 (\u201cThe chest thing we\u2019re all hearing at\nthe same time\u201d).\n  The prosecution also asked Sneed whether anyone had\nprescribed him any medication:\n     \u201cQ.

See post, at 1\u20136 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). To the\nextent the dissent relies on witnesses other than Sneed, their testimony\nconfirms no more than what Glossip himself admitted to the police. As\nfor Sneed\u2019s testimony, the dissent constructs its favored narrative from\namong his multiple inconsistent accounts of the murder. See supra, at\n3\u20135; compare post, at 2 (dissent asserting that \u201cSneed left [Van Treese\u2019s\nroom] when he thought that he had killed Van Treese\u201d), with 2 App. 665\n(Sneed telling police he left Van Treese\u2019s room when he thought Van\nTreese was \u201cknocked out\u201d); compare post, at 2 (dissent asserting Glossip\ntold Sneed \u201cthey would both be evicted if Glossip lost his job\u201d), with 2\nApp. 655\u2013665 (Sneed telling police that Van Treese\u2019s death was the acci-\ndental result of a robbery gone wrong), 6 Tr. 89 (June 8, 1998) (Sneed\ntestifying that he did not know why Glossip wanted him to kill Van\nTreese), and 12 Tr. 75 (May 26, 2004) (Sneed testifying that Glossip had\nwanted to rob Van Treese).\n\f6                  GLOSSIP v.

Finally, Sneed testified\nabout Glossip\u2019s purported motives for killing Van Treese.\nHe asserted that Glossip had suggested \u201crobbing Barry of\nhis money,\u201d id., at 75, that he had \u201ctold [Sneed] at one point\nthat with Mr. Van Treese out of the way . . . he would be\nable not only [to] manage the motel on Council but also an-\nother one they had [in Tulsa],\u201d id., at 89, and that he had\nworried he \u201cwas going to get fired\u201d because \u201ca couple of the\nrooms that were already supposed to be remodeled . . .\nweren\u2019t,\u201d id., at 95.\n   The prosecution weaved these suggestions into its closing\nargument along with its original theory that Glossip had\nwanted Van Treese dead to avoid being fired for embezzle-\nment. See 15 Tr. 65 (June 1, 2004) (arguing Glossip\u2019s mo-\ntive was \u201ca big wad of around 4,000 bucks of American good\nYankee dollars to split with the kid\u201d); id., at 153, 163 (argu-\ning Glossip was going to be fired because of \u201cmissing\nmoney\u201d); id., at 164\u2013165 (arguing Glossip was going to be\nfired because of the condition of the rooms). It then argued\nthat Sneed, \u201csatisfied and contented with [his] humble life,\u201d\nid., at 68, had no propensity to violence except at Glossip\u2019s\ndirection:\n    \u201c[I]t\u2019s as if Justin Sneed was a Rottweiler puppy, let\u2019s\n    say 11 months old, and Richard Glossip was the dog\n    trainer.

But no\n    matter how you slice it, no matter how you parse it, the\n    person that says \u2018sick\u2019 em\u2019 is the person that makes the\n    decision.\u201d Id., at 73.\n  The jury again convicted Glossip of capital murder and\nagain sentenced him to death.\n  A closely divided OCCA affirmed, holding that circum-\nstantial evidence suggesting Glossip had mismanaged the\nhotel, combined with the concession that Glossip had been\ndishonest in his initial statements after the murder, suffi-\nciently corroborated Sneed\u2019s testimony that he killed Van\nTreese at Glossip\u2019s direction. Glossip II, 157 P. 3d, at 151\u2013\n153. In dissent, Judge Chapel and Judge A. Johnson ar-\ngued that the majority \u201coverstate[d] the strength of the ac-\ncomplice corroboration evidence.\u201d Id., at 164\u2013165, 175.\n                               B\n   Glossip continued to maintain his innocence in the years\nafter his conviction, filing several habeas petitions in state\nand federal court. Although that litigation did not result in\nrelief, mounting concerns over the integrity of Glossip\u2019s con-\nviction drew the attention of the Oklahoma Legislature. A\nbipartisan group of 62 Oklahoma legislators retained a law\nfirm, Reed Smith, to conduct an independent investigation\ninto the case. Pet. for Cert. 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 390a\u2013\n391a. In June 2022, Reed Smith reported its \u201cgrave doubt\nas to the integrity of Glossip\u2019s murder conviction and death\nsentence.\u201d Independent Investigation of State v. Richard E.\nGlossip 6 (June 7, 2022). Among other things, Reed Smith\nconcluded the prosecution had deliberately destroyed \u201ckey\nphysical evidence\u201d before Glossip\u2019s retrial, including sev-\neral items from the crime scene and the inn\u2019s receipts and\ndeposit books, which could have helped Glossip address the\naccusations of embezzlement. Id., at 7, 9, n. 25, 34, 48.\nReed Smith further concluded that the State had \u201cfalsely\n\f8                       GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nportrayed Sneed at trial as a meek and non-violent \u2018pup-\npet,\u2019 \u201d id., at 10, and that key testimony about Glossip\u2019s mo-\ntive and actions on the morning after the murder had been\nprovided by a former police officer of \u201c \u2018very limited honesty\nand integrity\u2019 \u201d who was jailed for making false statements\nshortly after Glossip\u2019s second trial, id., at 6\u201312.\n    Two months after Reed Smith\u2019s report, the State dis-\nclosed seven boxes of previously withheld documents from\nGlossip\u2019s trials. Those boxes contained a note the head\nprosecutor, Connie Smothermon, sent to Sneed\u2019s lawyer be-\nfore Sneed testified at the second trial. Smothermon\u2019s note\nconcerned \u201ca few items that have been testified to that I\nneeded to discuss with Justin,\u201d including the \u201cbiggest prob-\nlem,\u201d which (the note said) was \u201cstill the knife.\u201d 3 App. 953.\nThe examiners\u2019 testimony about the knife was problematic,\nSmothermon\u2019s note explained, because \u201cJustin [told] the po-\nlice that the knife fell out of his pocket and that he didn\u2019t\nstab the victim with it,\u201d yet the victim had \u201c \u2018lacerations\u2019 \u201d\nconsistent with the \u201cknife blade.\u201d Ibid. It did not \u201cmake\nmuch sense\u201d to Smothermon, moreover, \u201cthat Justin could\nhave control of the bat and a knife\u201d on his own. Ibid. \u201c[W]e\nshould get to him this afternoon,\u201d the note concluded. Ibid.\n    The boxes further contained letters from Sneed to his at-\ntorney suggesting he had expressed a desire to recant his\ntestimony prior to Glossip\u2019s second trial. See id., at 811\u2013\n816. For example, in a letter dated May 15, 2003, Sneed\nwrote to his attorney asking \u201c \u2018do I have the choice of recant-\ning my testimony at any time during my life,\u2019 \u201d and is \u201c \u2018there\n. . . anything you know, on [Glossip\u2019s] court date and about\nre-canting.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 815; App. to Pet. for Cert. in Glossip v.\nOklahoma, No. 22\u20136500, at 192a. 2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dissent claims Sneed thought the phrase \u201c \u2018recan[t] my testi-\n\nmony\u2019 \u201d meant \u201c \u2018refuse to testify,\u2019 \u201d post, at 10, n. 2, meaning (on the dis-\nsent\u2019s view) Sneed asked his lawyer: \u201cIf I [testify] again, do I have the\nchoice of [refusing to testify] at any time during my life?\u201d The dissent\nfurther points to an interview Sneed gave decades later, where (with\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U.

Among other things, Glos-\nsip argued that, during his second trial, Smothermon had\ninterfered with Sneed\u2019s testimony about the knife in viola-\ntion of the rule of sequestration, which prohibits witnesses\nfrom hearing each other\u2019s testimony. 3 App. 785\u2013882. Ok-\nlahoma responded that Glossip\u2019s claims were meritless, but\nthat it would nonetheless waive any procedural defenses in\norder to mitigate the damage from a \u201cmedia campaign\u201d on\nGlossip\u2019s behalf. Id., at 717\u2013718. Oklahoma further asked\nthe OCCA to deny Glossip\u2019s claims on their merits so as \u201cto\ntrigger the state court deference anticipated in [the Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]\u201d in any future fed-\neral review. Id., at 718, n. 7. Noting that it alone would\n\u201cdetermine whether the rules of this Court should be aban-\ndoned,\u201d the OCCA held that Glossip\u2019s claims were procedur-\nally barred as well as meritless. Id., at 775\u2013783.\n   Shortly thereafter, the State \u201cunearthed disturbing reve-\nlations about the contents of \u201d an eighth box of trial docu-\nments \u201cconsisting of material it previously prevented the\ndefense from obtaining.\u201d Brief for Respondent 10. \u201cBuried\ninside Box 8,\u201d the State says, \u201cwas a page of notes hand-\nwritten by Smothermon during a pretrial interview with\nSneed,\u201d indicating \u201cthat Sneed had told Smothermon that\nhe was \u2018on lithium\u2019 not by mistake, but in connection with\na \u2018Dr. Trumpet.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general \u201cde-\nduced the import of these notes in short order\u201d: Only a sin-\ngle psychiatrist worked in the Oklahoma County jail when\nSneed was held there, and his name was Dr. Larry\nTrombka. Ibid.; see also 3 App. 930. A summary of Sneed\u2019s\nmedical records (previously withheld from Glossip\u2019s counsel\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGlossip\u2019s execution imminent) he denied ever \u201c \u2018want[ing] to change the\ntruth.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Of course, Sneed\u2019s much later denials do not erase his prior\nstatements about recanting.\n\f10                     GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nafter motion practice seeking their discovery) showed that\nSneed had received lithium to treat his undisclosed bipolar\ndisorder. Brief for Respondent 10; 3 App. 1005. After this\ndiscovery, Dr. Trombka signed an affidavit attesting that\nhe was the only medical professional at the jail who would\nhave prescribed Sneed lithium. Id., at 1003.\n  The attorney general accordingly determined that Sneed\n\u201cwas not in fact mis-prescribed lithium, but rather diag-\nnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with lithium under\nthe care of a psychiatrist\u201d\u2014and \u201cdespite her knowledge of\nthese facts,\u201d Smothermon \u201celicited false testimony from\nSneed\u201d on that subject. Brief for Respondent 11. 3\n  The attorney general thereafter disclosed Box 8 to Glos-\nsip and retained an independent counsel to conduct another\nreview of Glossip\u2019s conviction. As relevant here, the inde-\npendent counsel concluded that Smothermon\u2019s attempt to\ninterfere with Sneed\u2019s testimony about the knife violated\nthe rule of sequestration, that her failure to turn over\nSneed\u2019s statements about his mental health treatment vio-\nlated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), and that her\nfailure to correct Sneed\u2019s false trial testimony that he had\nbeen given lithium after asking for cold medicine violated\nNapue, 360 U. S. 264. App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 58a. His\nreport concluded:\n     \u201c[T]he State must vacate Glossip\u2019s conviction due to its\n     decades-long failure to disclose what I believe is Brady\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Also included in Box 8 were prosecutors\u2019 witness interview notes sug-\n\ngesting the State may have omitted certain details from the summaries\nit turned over to the defense. For example, one witness apparently told\nthe prosecution that Glossip had sold him a big screen TV and a couch\nfor $900, 3 App. 952\u2014a sum that would account for much of the cash\nGlossip had on his person at his arrest. That same witness testified at\ntrial that he did not know how much money Glossip had received for\nthose sales. 1 id., at 286. Glossip\u2019s girlfriend later explained in a post-\ntrial affidavit that Glossip had been selling their possessions to pay for\nan attorney. 2 id., at 703.\n\f                     Cite as: 604 U.

In my view, this case is also permeated by\n     failures to secure, safeguard, and maintain evidence in\n     a capital murder case.\u201d Id., at 62a.\n  Following the Box 8 disclosure and the independent coun-\nsel\u2019s recommendation, Glossip filed a successive petition for\npost-conviction relief with the OCCA asserting Brady, Na-\npue, cumulative error, and actual innocence claims. 4 The\nattorney general filed a \u201cResponse in Support of Petitioner\u2019s\nSuccessive Application for Post-Conviction Relief.\u201d 3 App.\n973. Although the attorney general did not endorse Glos-\nsip\u2019s actual innocence claim, he represented that his office\nhad \u201cconcluded that Justin Sneed . . . made material mis-\nstatements to the jury regarding his psychiatric treatment\nand the reasons for his lithium prescription,\u201d which the\nState had failed to correct in violation of Napue. 3 App. 974.\nIn addition, the State indicated it was \u201cconcerned that there\nwere multiple and cumulative errors, such as violation of\nthe rule of sequestration and destruction of evidence, that\nwhen taken together with Sneed\u2019s misstatements warrant\u201d\na new trial. Ibid.; see also id., at 977 (\u201c[T]he State believes\nGlossip is entitled to post-conviction relief \u201d); id., at 978\n(State is \u201ccompelled, consistent with Napue,\u201d to correct mis-\nstatements); id., at 979 (\u201c[T]he State requests that the\nCourt vacate Glossip\u2019s conviction and that the case be re-\nmanded to the district court\u201d). Because Oklahoma agreed\nwith Glossip on the pertinent facts, it did not request an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent faults Glossip for \u201cignor[ing] the lithium issue on direct\n\nappeal\u201d years earlier. Post, at 7\u20138. Glossip had no reason to know at the\ntime of his direct appeal that Smothermon knowingly failed to correct\nSneed\u2019s false testimony about why he had been given lithium, however,\nso he would have had no occasion to raise his Napue or Brady claims\nthen.\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n  The OCCA denied Glossip\u2019s unopposed petition without a\nhearing. It acknowledged the attorney general\u2019s request\nthat Glossip\u2019s conviction be vacated, noting that this con-\ncession alone could not \u201cdirectly\u201d provide a ground for relief.\n529 P. 3d, at 223. The court said the following about the\nState\u2019s confession of Napue error:\n     \u201cGlossip claims that the State failed to disclose evi-\n     dence of Justin Sneed\u2019s mental health treatment and\n     that Sneed lied about his mental health treatment to\n     the jury. Though the State in its response now con-\n     cedes that this alleged false testimony combined with\n     other unspecified cumulative errors warrant post-\n     conviction relief, the concession alone cannot overcome\n     the limitations on successive post-conviction review.\n     See 22 O.S. Supp. 2022, \u00a71089(D)(8). The State\u2019s con-\n     cession is not based in law or fact.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226\n     (footnote omitted).\nThe OCCA then applied Oklahoma\u2019s Post-Conviction Pro-\ncedures Act (PCPA) to hold that Glossip\u2019s claims were pro-\ncedurally barred. It concluded separately that the evidence\npresented by the parties did not \u201ccreate a Napue error.\u201d\nIbid. (footnote omitted).\n   This Court thereafter stayed Glossip\u2019s execution at the\njoint request of the parties and granted certiorari to con-\nsider Glossip\u2019s Brady and Napue claims and the effect of the\nattorney general\u2019s confession of error. 5 601 U. S. ___ (2024).\nThe Court also requested argument on an additional ques-\ntion: whether the OCCA\u2019s holding that the PCPA precluded\npost-conviction relief is an adequate and independent state-\nlaw ground for the judgment.\n   Because Oklahoma agrees with Glossip on the merits of\nhis appeal, the Court appointed Christopher Michel as ami-\ncus curiae to defend the judgment below. 601 U.

Arizona, 598 U. S. 17, 25 (2023) (quoting\nLee v. Kemna, 534 U. S. 362, 375 (2002)). \u201cIn the context of\ndirect review of a state court judgment, the independent\nand adequate state ground doctrine is jurisdictional.\u201d Cole-\nman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991). A state\nground of decision is independent only when it does not de-\npend on a federal holding, Foster v. Chatman, 578 U. S. 488,\n498 (2016), and also is not intertwined with questions of\nfederal law, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041\n(1983). \u201c[W]hen the adequacy and independence of any pos-\nsible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opin-\nion, we will accept as the most reasonable explanation that\nthe state court decided the case the way it did because it\nbelieved that federal law required it to do so.\u201d Ibid.\n   Amicus argues this Court lacks jurisdiction because the\nOCCA held that Glossip\u2019s claims were barred under the\nPCPA, and the PCPA is \u201ca paradigmatic independent and\nadequate state-law ground.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed\nAmicus Curiae 13. That argument fails because it over-\nlooks an antecedent holding that turned on federal law.\nThe OCCA first rejected the attorney general\u2019s confession\nof Napue error, deeming it meritless and therefore incapa-\nble of \u201covercom[ing]\u201d application of the PCPA. 529 P. 3d, at\n226. Only then did it apply the PCPA to Glossip. Because\nthe OCCA\u2019s decision to reject the attorney general\u2019s confes-\nsion of error rested exclusively on federal law, so too did its\nsubsequent decision to apply the PCPA.\n\f14                     GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In his brief to the OCCA, the attorney general disclaimed\nreliance on any procedural defenses, including the PCPA.\nInstead, the attorney general \u201cconcede[d] error under Na-\npue,\u201d 3 App. 978, acknowledging that, as a matter of federal\nlaw, the prosecution\u2019s knowing failure to correct Sneed\u2019s\n\u201cmaterial misstatements\u201d entitled Glossip to a new trial.\nId., at 977, 978, 979. The OCCA held that this confession\nof Napue error could not \u201covercome the [PCPA\u2019s] limitations\non successive post-conviction review\u201d because it was \u201cnot\nbased in law or fact.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226. Specifically, the\nOCCA concluded that the underlying evidence \u201cd[id] not\ncreate a Napue error.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted). Thus, the\nOCCA\u2019s application of the PCPA over the attorney general\u2019s\nconfession of error depended on its determination that no\nNapue violation had occurred. That was a federal holding,\nand it was the only reason the OCCA provided for its con-\nclusion that the attorney general\u2019s confession could not\n\u201covercome\u201d the PCPA. Ibid. The PCPA therefore poses no\nimpediment to our review in this case.\n   Oklahoma precedent involving confessions of error by an\nattorney general confirms this reading. As the OCCA has\nrepeatedly explained, it will normally reject an attorney\ngeneral\u2019s confession of error only after finding that it lacks\na basis in the law and in the record. See, e.g., Bindrum v.\nState, 27 Okla. Crim. 372, 228 P. 168 (1924) (\u201cWhere the\nAttorney General confesses error, th[e] court will examine\nthe record, and, if the confession is sustained thereby, and\nis well founded in law, the conviction will be reversed\u201d (syl-\nlabus by the court)). 6 Otherwise, if the confession of error\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 See also Raymer v.

The OCCA applied that same rule here: It re-\njected the attorney general\u2019s confession of error as having\nno basis \u201cin law or fact,\u201d and explained that it would there-\nfore apply the PCPA. 529 P. 3d, at 226.\n   In doing so, the OCCA \u201cmade application of the proce-\ndural bar depend on an antecedent ruling on federal law,\nthat is, on the determination of whether federal constitu-\ntional error ha[d] been committed.\u201d Ake v. Oklahoma, 470\nU. S. 68, 75 (1985). After all, it made application of the\nPCPA contingent on its determination that the attorney\ngeneral\u2019s confession of federal constitutional error had no\nbasis in law or fact. To the extent that the OCCA\u2019s reason-\ning on this point is insufficiently \u201cclear from the face of the\nopinion,\u201d we nonetheless presume reliance on federal law\nunder Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S., at 1040\u20131041. This\nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to review the judgment be-\nlow.\n                            B\n  The dissent dismisses all this as an \u201cinvent[ed] . . . fed-\neral holding that the OCCA never made.\u201d Post, at 18. As\nthe dissent sees it, the OCCA rejected the attorney gen-\neral\u2019s confession of error because (the dissent says) the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1924) (same); Day v.

State, 100 Okla. 267, 268, 229 P. 231, 232 (1924)\n(establishing identical rule in civil forfeiture context).\n  7 The PCPA would not stand in the way of a reversal under this rule\n\nbecause it is not a jurisdictional bar. See Valdez v. State, 2002 OK CR\n20, \u00b6\u00b624\u201328, 46 P. 3d 703, 710.\n\f16                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nState failed adequately to address all of the PCPA\u2019s proce-\ndural requirements. See post, at 19. The OCCA plainly\nheld that the attorney general\u2019s confession was \u201cnot based\nin law or fact,\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226, however, forcing the dis-\nsent to provide an awkward explanation that this holding\nabout a federal confession of error on the merits was only\nabout the PCPA\u2019s state-law, procedural requirements.\nPost, at 19. Yet the State expressly attempted to waive\nthose procedural requirements by arguing that Glossip was\nentitled to a new trial. 3 App. 979 (\u201c[T]he State requests\nthat the Court vacate Glossip\u2019s conviction and that the case\nbe remanded to the district court\u201d). So to explain away the\n\u201cbased in law or fact\u201d language, the dissent must proceed\non the assumption that Oklahoma law requires applicants\nto satisfy the PCPA\u2019s nonjurisdictional provisions even\nwhen the State waives them and even if the State\u2019s confes-\nsion of constitutional error is otherwise meritorious\u2014not-\nwithstanding the many other contexts where the OCCA\nprivileges meritorious confessions of error. See n. 6, supra\n(collecting cases); App. to Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 1a\u201321a (cata-\nloging the OCCA\u2019s decisions in the 298 confession-of-error\ncases predating Glossip\u2019s, all of which resulted in relief ).\n  That assumption is hardly \u201cclear from the face of the\nopinion\u201d below. Long, 463 U. S., at 1041. Thus, we must\n\u201caccept as the most reasonable explanation that the state\ncourt decided the case the way it did because it believed\nthat federal law required it to do so.\u201d Ibid.\n                             III\n                              A\n  Turning to the merits, we conclude that the prosecution\nviolated its constitutional obligation to correct false testi-\nmony.\n  In Napue v.

To establish a Napue violation, a defendant\nmust show that the prosecution knowingly solicited false\ntestimony or knowingly allowed it \u201cto go uncorrected when\nit appear[ed].\u201d Ibid. If the defendant makes that showing,\na new trial is warranted so long as the false testimony \u201cmay\nhave had an effect on the outcome of the trial,\u201d id., at 272\u2014\nthat is, if it \u201c \u2018in any reasonable likelihood [could] have af-\nfected the judgment of the jury,\u2019 \u201d Giglio v. United States,\n405 U. S. 150, 154 (1972) (quoting Napue, 360 U. S., at 271).\nIn effect, this materiality standard requires \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe benefi-\nciary of [the] constitutional error to prove beyond a reason-\nable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute\nto the verdict obtained.\u201d \u2019 \u201d United States v. Bagley, 473\nU. S. 667, 680, n. 9 (1985) (quoting Chapman v. California,\n386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)).\n   Here, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general joins Glossip in as-\nserting a Napue error, conceding both that Sneed\u2019s testi-\nmony was false and that the prosecution knowingly failed\nto correct it. The record supports that confession of error.\nA summary of Sneed\u2019s medical records created by the local\nsheriff \u2019s department establishes that someone diagnosed\nSneed with bipolar disorder and prescribed him lithium. 3\nApp. 1005. Dr. Trombka, a psychiatrist, attested in a sworn\naffidavit that he was the only medical professional at the\nOklahoma County jail who would have issued Sneed that\nprescription. Id., at 930\u2013931. Dr. Trombka also confirmed,\nand nobody contests, that lithium is used only in psychiat-\nric treatments and not for dental pain (as Sneed said at a\npretrial hearing) or a cold (as Sneed testified at Glossip\u2019s\ntrial). Ibid. Nor would anyone confuse lithium with Su-\ndafed, which is a cold medication. Ibid. Sneed\u2019s trial testi-\nmony that he had been given lithium after asking for Su-\ndafed and had \u201cnever seen no psychiatrist or anything\u201d was\ntherefore false.\n   The evidence likewise establishes that the prosecution\n\f18                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknew Sneed\u2019s statements were false as he testified to them.\nThe prosecution almost certainly had access to Sneed\u2019s\nmedical file, which would have listed both the lithium pre-\nscription and the bipolar diagnosis. Among other things,\nthose records would have been provided to the State as part\nof Sneed\u2019s competency evaluation, id., at 931, and the State\nopposed Glossip\u2019s discovery request of Sneed\u2019s medical files\non its merits, 2 id., at 622\u2013623; 3 id., at 933. As amicus and\nthe dissent emphasize, moreover, \u201c[l]ithium is prescribed\nonly for mood disorders.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus\nCuriae 14; post, at 7 (\u201cIt is undisputed that lithium\u2019s sole\nmedical purpose, both in 1997 and today, is to treat bipolar\ndisorder and other mental health disorders\u201d). Yet the pros-\necution knew that Sneed had previously told a competency\nevaluator that he had been prescribed lithium \u201cafter his\ntooth was pulled,\u201d 2 App. 700; that statement was part of a\ncompetency record to which both the State and Glossip had\naccess, id., at 698\u2013703. Prosecutors then heard Sneed tes-\ntify to a different version of events at trial: that the lithium\nhad been given to him after he asked for Sudafed because\nhe had a cold. 1 id., at 312.\n   In addition, Smothermon\u2019s notes show that she had a pre-\ntrial conversation with Sneed at which he mentioned \u201clith-\nium\u201d and \u201cDr. Trumpet.\u201d 3 id., at 927. Glossip argues, and\nthe attorney general admits, that this shows Sneed told\nSmothermon that Dr. Trumpet (meaning Dr. Trombka) had\nprescribed him lithium. As just discussed, the record shows\nthat, in fact, Dr. Trombka did diagnose Sneed with bipolar\ndisorder and prescribe him lithium. Sneed plainly dis-\ncussed these matters with the prosecution. In that private\nconversation, he would have had little to gain from prevar-\nicating about his prescriptions, nor do the notes suggest he\ndid anything of the kind. The straightforward inference is\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Sneed told Smothermon that Dr. Trombka had pre-\nscribed him the lithium. 8\n   That leaves materiality. Evidence can be material even\nif it \u201cgoes only to the credibility of the witness,\u201d Napue, 360\nU. S., at 269; indeed, \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s estimate of the truthful-\nness and reliability of a given witness may well be determi-\nnative of guilt or innocence,\u201d ibid. Because Sneed\u2019s testi-\nmony was the only direct evidence of Glossip\u2019s guilt of\ncapital murder, the jury\u2019s assessment of Sneed\u2019s credibility\nwas necessarily determinative here. Besides Sneed, no\nother witness and no physical evidence established that\nGlossip orchestrated Van Treese\u2019s murder. Thus, the jury\ncould convict Glossip only if it believed Sneed.\n   Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his\ncredibility plainly would have suffered. That correction\nwould have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was un-\ntrustworthy (as amicus points out, the jury already knew\nhe repeatedly lied to the police), but also that Sneed was\nwilling to lie to them under oath. Such a revelation would\nbe significant in any case, and was especially so here where\nSneed was already \u201cnobody\u2019s idea of a strong witness.\u201d\nBrief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 37. Even if\nSneed\u2019s bipolar disorder were wholly irrelevant, as amicus\nargues, his willingness to lie about it to the jury was not.\n\u201c \u2018A lie is a lie, no matter what its subject.\u2019 \u201d Napue, 360\nU. S., at 269 (quoting People v. Savvides, 1 N. Y. 2d 554,\n557, 136 N. E. 2d 853, 854\u2013855 (1956)).\n   Sneed\u2019s false testimony also bore on Glossip\u2019s guilt in a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent claims Sneed instead repeated his prior false statement\n\nthat he had been given the lithium after having his tooth pulled. See\npost, at 12, 13, n. 3, 25, n. 6, 42. Yet the dissent\u2019s only source for this\ntheory, Smothermon\u2019s co-counsel Gary Ackley, acknowledged under oath\nthat he knew lithium was not a pain medication, 3 App. 940, meaning he\nwould have known this story, too, to be wrong. In any event, even if the\nprosecution did believe Sneed had been given lithium for a toothache,\nthat still would have put them on notice that Sneed\u2019s testimony at trial\n(about receiving lithium after asking for cold medication) was false.\n\f20                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore direct way. As Smothermon\u2019s co-counsel Gary Ackley\nhas conceded, it \u201cwould have been an important fact for the\ndefense to know\u201d that Sneed had been prescribed lithium to\ntreat bipolar disorder. 3 App. 940. After the Box 8 disclo-\nsures, Dr. Trombka explained to Glossip\u2019s counsel that bi-\npolar disorder symptoms \u201ccan be exacerbated by illicit drug\nuse, such as methamphetamine,\u201d to \u201ccause an individual to\nbe more paranoid or potentially violent.\u201d Id., at 932. Sneed\nadmitted at trial that he regularly used drugs, including\nmethamphetamine. His diagnosis with a disorder that\ncould trigger impulsive violence when combined with drug\nuse thus would have undermined the prosecution\u2019s theory\nthat Sneed was harmless on his own\u2014a Rottweiler puppy\nbeholden to his trainer. 15 Tr. 73 (June 1, 2004). That the-\nory was an important part of the prosecution\u2019s case and fea-\ntured prominently in its opening and closing statements.\nSee, e.g., 3 Tr. 209 (May 13, 2004) (arguing in opening that\nSneed was \u201cpretty content . . . to do whatever it is that Rich-\nard Glossip wanted him to do\u201d); 15 Tr. 69\u201374 (June 1, 2004)\n(emphasizing in closing that Sneed would have never com-\nmitted murder without Glossip). Hence there is a reasona-\nble likelihood that correcting Sneed\u2019s testimony would have\naffected the judgment of the jury. Napue, 360 U. S., at 271.\n  Amicus objects that \u201cthe jury already knew that Sneed\nhad been prescribed lithium, used illegal drugs, and be-\nhaved impulsively; he admitted that he beat a man to death\nwith a baseball bat in the middle of the night with no ad-\nvanced planning.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Cu-\nriae 36. As amicus sees it, the additional evidence provided\nby Sneed\u2019s lie and his treatment for bipolar disorder could\nhardly have made a difference in light of so much other im-\npeaching evidence. Id., at 36\u201337. Of course, at trial, the\nprosecution urged the jury to believe just the opposite: that\ndespite his prior dishonesty and violence, Sneed was now\ntelling the truth. See, e.g., 15 Tr. 153\u2013155 (June 1, 2004).\nA prosecutor\u2019s midtrial revelation that Sneed lied on the\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstand would have significantly undercut that argument.\n   In any event, amicus\u2019s position is self-defeating. If the\nevidence impeaching Sneed\u2019s credibility was already over-\nwhelming, then no reasonable jury could have convicted\nGlossip in the first place, given that the prosecution\u2019s case\nrested centrally on Sneed\u2019s credibility. Amicus appears to\nassume the jury would have believed Sneed no matter\nwhat. Such an assumption has no place in a materiality\nanalysis, which asks what a reasonable decisionmaker\nwould have done with the new evidence. See Wearry v.\nCain, 577 U. S. 385, 393\u2013394 (2016) (per curiam) (rejecting\nargument that evidence was immaterial because witness\u2019s\ncredibility was \u201calready impugned\u201d); cf. Strickland v. Wash-\nington, 466 U. S. 668, 695 (1984).\n   Although the prosecution\u2019s failure to correct Sneed\u2019s false\ntestimony was a material Napue violation on its own, addi-\ntional conduct by the prosecution further undermines con-\nfidence in the verdict. The attorney general has confessed\nto \u201c \u2018violation of the rule of sequestration\u2019 \u201d with respect to\nSmothermon\u2019s apparent midtrial attempt to speak with\nSneed about the knife, as well as to \u201c \u2018destruction of evi-\ndence,\u2019 \u201d including the hotel\u2019s financial records and items\nGlossip and Sneed allegedly handled in Van Treese\u2019s room.\nSee Brief for Respondent 13; 3 App. 935 (prosecutor Ackley\nattesting under oath that \u201cI was informed that a box of evi-\ndence containing 10 items was destroyed by the Oklahoma\nCity Police Department. . . . It is likely that I was aware of\nthat fact during the 2004 retrial . . . . That this happened\nhorrifies me\u201d); Independent Investigation of State v. Rich-\nard E. Glossip, at 7, 12\u201313, 41\u201343 (cataloging destroyed\nitems). In addition, the eight boxes of documents released\nto Glossip included statements from Sneed evincing a de-\nsire to recant his testimony and witness notes with details\nnot previously turned over to the defense. For example, the\nfiles suggest one witness told the prosecution (contrary to\nhis trial testimony) that Glossip sold him a couch and a TV\n\f22                     GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor $900. 3 App. 952. That evidence would have supported\nGlossip\u2019s account of the cash he carried at his arrest outside\nan attorney\u2019s office: that he had sold his possessions to pay\nfor an attorney. See 2 id., at 703. Because prejudice anal-\nysis requires a \u201ccumulative evaluation\u201d of all the evidence,\nwhether or not that evidence is before the Court in the form\nof an independent claim for relief, these documents rein-\nforce our conclusion that the Napue error here prejudiced\nthe defense. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 441 (1995). 9\n  For these reasons, we conclude that the prosecution\u2019s fail-\nure to correct Sneed\u2019s trial testimony violated the Due Pro-\ncess Clause. Glossip is entitled to a new trial.\n                           B\n  The OCCA\u2019s contrary holding rested on a mistaken inter-\npretation of Napue. According to the OCCA, there was no\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The dissent\u2019s attempts to minimize these issues are unpersuasive.\n\nSneed\u2019s letter inquiring about \u201c \u2018the choice of recanting my testimony,\u2019 \u201d\n3 App. 815, disproves the dissent\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere is no evidence\nSneed wished to \u2018recant\u2019 his testimony.\u201d Post, at 32. That Glossip re-\ncalled receiving only $490 for his possessions during his first trial does\nnot absolve the prosecution from its ordinary duty to disclose incon-\nsistent statements by its witnesses. Contra, post, at 32\u201333. The State\u2019s\nconceded sequestration violation also is not merely an insignificant state-\nlaw issue, ibid.; like any other attorney, a prosecutor may not seek to\ninfluence the content of a witness\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., Geders v. United\nStates, 425 U. S. 80, 90, n. 3 (1976) (\u201cAn attorney must respect the im-\nportant ethical distinction between discussing testimony and seeking im-\nproperly to influence it\u201d). The dissent labors to discredit certain \u201chand-\nwritten notes\u201d on which neither Glossip nor this Court relies, see post, at\n32, n. 8, but Smothermon undisputedly wrote to Sneed\u2019s counsel that she\nneeded to \u201cget to\u201d him \u201cto discuss\u201d his problematic testimony about the\nknife. 3 App. 953. The next day, Sneed\u2019s testimony corrected the very\nproblem raised by Smothermon\u2019s letter. Smothermon nonetheless dis-\nclaimed any knowledge of Sneed\u2019s change in testimony when Glossip ob-\njected. 12 Tr. 107\u2013108 (May 26, 2004). Finally, not even the original\nprosecutors dispute that the police destroyed key evidence before Glos-\nsip\u2019s retrial; the dissent nonetheless dismisses that claim, undisputed for\nover two decades, as this Court\u2019s \u201cown creation.\u201d Post, at 32.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

As an initial matter, Sneed\u2019s false testimony con-\ncerned the reasons for his lithium prescription, not the\nmere fact that he had taken it. Glossip\u2019s counsel was aware\nof the latter, not of the former. In any event, the Due Pro-\ncess Clause imposes \u201c \u2018the responsibility and duty to cor-\nrect\u2019 \u201d false testimony on \u201crepresentatives of the State,\u201d not\non defense counsel. Napue, 360 U. S., at 269\u2013270 (quoting\nSavvides, 1 N. Y. 2d, at 557, 136 N. E., at 854).\n   The OCCA also held that Sneed\u2019s testimony was not\n\u201cclearly false\u201d because Sneed was \u201cmore than likely in de-\nnial of his mental health disorders.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226, 227.\nIt is not apparent why the OCCA thought Sneed was in de-\nnial, nor why such denial should have caused Sneed to be-\nlieve that he had never seen a psychiatrist, when in fact he\nhad. Even supposing it did, however, Sneed\u2019s beliefs are\nbeside the point. What matters is that his testimony was\nfalse and a prosecutor knowingly let it stand nonetheless.\nNapue, 360 U. S., at 269 (\u201c[I]t is established that a convic-\ntion obtained through use of false evidence, known to be\nsuch by representatives of the State, must fall under the\nFourteenth Amendment\u201d).\n   The dissent\u2019s arguments in support of the OCCA\u2019s conclu-\nsions fare no better. As an initial matter, even the dissent\ndoes not dispute that Sneed falsely testified he had never\nseen a psychiatrist.

E. 2d, at 854\u2013\n855)). Nothing in Napue requires ignoring the fact of\nSneed\u2019s perjury in the prejudice analysis. To the contrary,\nmateriality instead always requires courts to assess\nwhether \u201cthe error complained of \u201d could have contributed\nto the verdict. Chapman, 386 U. S., at 24; Bagley, 473 U. S.,\nat 680, n. 9. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct Sneed\u2019s\nfalse testimony is the relevant error, so the Court asks\nwhether a correction could have made a material difference.\nThe answer is clearly yes. See supra, at 18\u201322. 10\n   The remaining arguments offered in defense of the\nOCCA\u2019s position are likewise unpersuasive. In an amicus\nbrief, the Van Treese family argues that it was Glossip\u2019s\ncounsel who asked Sneed about his lithium prescription,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent also argues Sneed\u2019s lithium use was immaterial because\n\n\u201cthe defense chose not to turn\u201d it \u201cinto an impeachment issue,\u201d post, at\n27, but each premise in that argument is mistaken. First, the defense\ndid not choose \u201cnot to raise Sneed\u2019s mental condition,\u201d ibid.; they asked\nhim about it in cross-examination and Sneed repeated his false testi-\nmony. See 13 Tr. 15 (May 27, 2004). Second, the defense did not know\nduring trial that Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder; to the\ncontrary, Glossip later sought (and the State successfully opposed) dis-\ncovery on that issue. 2 App. 621\u2013622. Third, even if the defense had\nmade a conscious choice not to raise the (then-uncertain) reasons for\nSneed\u2019s lithium use, that would be irrelevant to the prosecution\u2019s duty to\ncorrect false testimony \u201cwhen it appears.\u201d Napue, 360 U.

See Brief for Victim\nFamily Members as Amici Curiae 7\u201322. That argument re-\nlies heavily on extra-record materials not properly before\nthe Court, including a recent unsworn statement from\nSmothermon adopting the family\u2019s interpretation of the\nnotes. (The dissent, which criticizes the independent coun-\nsel for \u201cimpugning\u201d the trial prosecutors\u2019 reputation, post,\nat 15, justifies its reliance on these materials by accusing\nthe Oklahoma attorney general of \u201ccollusively exclud[ing]\u201d\nthem from the record, see post, at 42.) Nor would accepting\nthe family\u2019s account change the Napue analysis. Whatever\nthe impetus for the conversation, the family agrees that\nSneed and Smothermon discussed Dr. Trombka and lith-\nium. The natural inference is that Sneed explained to\nSmothermon the circumstances that led to his lithium use.\nTo avoid that inference, the family in turn suggests both\nthat Sneed was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder in\nthe first place, Brief for Victim Family Members as Amici\nCuriae 17, and that Glossip\u2019s counsel \u201cknew about [Dr.\nTrombka] more than two decades ago,\u201d id., at 21. Yet for\nthe reasons previously explained, defense counsel\u2019s pur-\nported knowledge of Dr. Trombka\u2019s existence is irrelevant,\nand the prison medical record supports the attorney gen-\neral\u2019s concession that Sneed received a lithium prescription\nas treatment for his bipolar disorder.\n   The family also maintains (and the dissent agrees) that\nReed Smith and the independent counsel spent insufficient\ntime interviewing Smothermon. Neither the family nor\nSmothermon raised that objection before the OCCA, nor\ndoes anyone now explain its relevance to the Napue analy-\nsis. The argument is also unpersuasive on its own terms.\nBoth investigators spoke to Smothermon. When they did,\nSmothermon did not provide the account she now endorses:\nthat Sneed relayed to her a conversation with Glossip\u2019s\ncounsel about Dr. Trombka and lithium. Instead, during a\n\f26                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthird interview, Smothermon asked the independent coun-\nsel \u201cwhy he thought it was Dr Trombka and not Dr Trumpet\nthe jazz musician and I was making a personal note or\nsomething else.\u201d App. to Brief for Victim Family Members\nas Amici Curiae 31a. There is no compelling evidence that\na fourth or fifth consultation with Smothermon would have\nyielded materially different results.\n   The Court-appointed amicus, for his part, largely aban-\ndons the OCCA\u2019s reasoning and focuses instead on ambigu-\nities in Smothermon\u2019s notes. Amicus maintains that too\nmany inferential steps separate those notes from the con-\nclusion that Sneed lied on the stand and that Smothermon\nknew it. For example, amicus argues that \u201cthe parties do\nnot explain the basis for their asserted link between \u2018Dr.\nTrumpet?\u2019 and Trombka,\u201d reiterating Smothermon\u2019s earlier\nstatements that she \u201c \u2018is not convinced that Dr. Trombka\nand \u201cDr. Trumpet\u201d are the same person.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae 32. As already explained, how-\never, there is ample evidence in the record before this Court\nsupporting the inference that Smothermon knew about\nSneed\u2019s psychiatric treatment and lithium prescription, in-\ncluding the prison medical record, Dr. Trombka\u2019s attesta-\ntions, and Smothermon\u2019s own notes.\n   Because ample evidence supports the attorney general\u2019s\nconfession of error in this Court, there also is no need to\nremand for further evidentiary proceedings at the OCCA.\nIndeed, that such proceedings are not necessary is the one\npoint on which Glossip, Oklahoma, amicus, and the OCCA\nunanimously agree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 108 (amicus con-\nceding that \u201cI guess we all agree that [an evidentiary hear-\ning is] not . . . that it\u2019s not necessary\u201d). The partial concur-\nrence suggests this Court should nonetheless remand for\nfurther proceedings on the ground that the evidence does\nnot remove all doubt that the attorney general\u2019s view of the\nrecord is correct.

In doing\nso, it relied on a procedural rule whose application turned\non the merits of a federal claim: \u201c \u2018Where the Attorney Gen-\neral confesses error, [the OCCA] will examine the record,\nand if the confession is sustained thereby, and is well\nfounded in law, the conviction will be reversed.\u2019 \u201d See supra,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The dissent would order a hearing to provide \u201cthe Van Treese family\n\n[with] the opportunity to present its case.\u201d Post, at 43 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). The family has not requested an evidentiary hearing (or\nparticipation in one) at any stage before the OCCA and does not request\nthat relief before this Court. Nor has the OCCA ever extended Oklahoma\nvictims\u2019 right to participate in criminal proceedings to state post-convic-\ntion hearings. Cf. post, at 42\u201343.

Here, the attorney general\n\u201cconcede[ d] error under Napue,\u201d 3 App. 978, and the OCCA\nrejected that confession because it wrongly concluded that\nno such federal error had occurred. See supra, at 15. Be-\ncause the Napue confession was \u201cwell founded in law,\u201d it\nfollows that \u201cthe conviction will be reversed.\u201d Bindrum, 27\nOkla. Crim., at 372, 228 P., at 168. Accordingly, all that\nremains below is to vacate the conviction, and a new trial\nfollows a fortiori.\n   The dissent concludes otherwise because, in its view, a\nremand for further consideration of alternative state\ngrounds is mandatory in every case where Michigan v. Long\nresolves lingering doubt over the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Post,\nat 34\u201336. Long describes the circumstances under which\nthis Court has jurisdiction to review a state-court judg-\nment; it does not limit the Court\u2019s remedial authority over\nan established federal constitutional violation. Nor does\nany other precedent support the dissent\u2019s rule.

The OCCA did not\nmake factual findings on the most important questions, and\nthe record is open to multiple plausible interpretations.\nConsistent with our ordinary practice, the Court should\nhave corrected the OCCA\u2019s misstatement of Napue v. Illi-\nnois and remanded this case for further proceedings. 360\nU. S. 264 (1959). Instead, the Court has drawn its own con-\nclusions about what the record shows, thereby exceeding its\nrole.\n   I begin with the common ground. At the threshold, I\nagree with the Court\u2019s jurisdictional holding and therefore\njoin Part II of its opinion. We lack jurisdiction to review a\nstate court\u2019s adjudication of federal claims if the state\ncourt\u2019s decision \u201crests on a state law ground that is inde-\npendent of the federal question and adequate to support the\njudgment.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729\n(1991). But when a state-law ground of decision is inter-\ntwined with analysis of a federal question, we will treat the\ndecision as independent only if the state court \u201cmake[s]\nclear by a plain statement\u201d that its resolution of the state-\nlaw question does not depend on its resolution of the federal\n\f2                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     Opinion of BARRETT, J.\n\nquestion. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983).\nThough it is a closer question for me than it is for the Court,\nI agree that the OCCA\u2019s opinion does not clear this bar.\nTrue, the OCCA rejected Glossip\u2019s application based on\nstate-law procedural limits on postconviction relief. But the\nopinion can be read to say that the OCCA refused to accept\nthe attorney general\u2019s waiver of this procedural bar because\nhis confession of error was not \u201cbased in law.\u201d 2023 OK CR\n5, \u00b625, 529 P. 3d 218, 226. If that is what the OCCA meant,\nthen its reliance on state law depended on the merits of\nGlossip\u2019s federal claims. After all, if the trial contained fed-\neral constitutional error, then the attorney general\u2019s confes-\nsion of error may have been \u201cbased in law.\u201d Because the\nopinion lacks a \u201cplain statement\u201d clarifying that the\nOCCA\u2019s reliance on state law was truly independent of its\nassessment of Glossip\u2019s federal claims, the Court rightly\nproceeds to the merits. Michigan, 463 U. S., at 1041.\n   I also share the Court\u2019s view that the OCCA misapplied\nNapue. The OCCA appeared to think that Justin Sneed\u2019s\ntestimony \u201cwas not clearly false\u201d because he \u201cwas more\nthan likely in denial of his mental health disorders.\u201d 529\nP. 3d, at 227. But for purposes of Napue, the question is not\nwhether a witness subjectively thought he was lying\u2014it is\nwhether the prosecution knowingly presented untrue testi-\nmony. The OCCA also stated that Sneed\u2019s \u201cknown mental\nhealth treatment evidence\u201d would not have created a \u201crea-\nsonable probability that the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different had Sneed\u2019s testimony regarding his\nuse of lithium been further developed at trial.\u201d 529 P. 3d,\nat 227. Yet the OCCA ignored the critical fact that\u2014had\nthe prosecutor, Connie Smothermon, corrected Sneed\u2019s tes-\ntimony\u2014the jury would have learned that Sneed made a\nfalse statement on the stand. Sneed\u2019s testimony was the\nprimary evidence that the State offered to prove that Glos-\nsip planned the murder. Faced with a prosecutor forced to\ncorrect her star witness, a juror might have disbelieved\n\f                    Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                   3\n\n                        Opinion of BARRETT, J.\n\nSneed\u2019s testimony in its entirety. And if a juror went from\nbelief to disbelief in Sneed, she might have changed her ul-\ntimate assessment of whether the State had proved Glos-\nsip\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So if Sneed really did\ngive false testimony, and if Smothermon really did know-\ningly allow that testimony to go uncorrected, then Smother-\nmon violated Glossip\u2019s due process rights under Napue.\nThe OCCA\u2019s contrary statements were wrong as a matter\nof federal law.\n   I part ways with the Court on what comes next. In exer-\ncising our appellate function, it is not our role to find facts;\ninstead, we review the factual findings of lower courts, sub-\nject to a deferential standard of appellate review. See Price\nv. Johnston, 334 U. S. 266, 291 (1948). This practice makes\ngood sense. This Court is well equipped to answer ques-\ntions of federal law; it is ill equipped either to determine the\ncredibility of witnesses or to master voluminous trial rec-\nords. Other actors in our judicial system\u2014including, where\nappropriate, state courts like the OCCA\u2014better serve these\nfunctions, as our standard of review reflects. In this case,\nhowever, the Court has chosen to function as the initial\nfactfinder.\n   To establish a violation of Napue, Glossip must show that\n(1) Sneed gave false testimony and (2) Smothermon knew\nthat the testimony was false. To make these showings,\nGlossip relies largely on notes taken by Smothermon, an af-\nfidavit from Dr. Trombka, and a \u201cmedical information\nsheet.\u201d According to the Court, these documents clearly\ndemonstrate that (1) Sneed lied when he said that he did\nnot know why he had been given lithium and that he had\nnever seen a psychiatrist and (2) Smothermon knew that\nboth of these statements were lies. See ante, at 17\u201319, 26.\nThus, the Court concludes, there is no need for the OCCA\nto make its own factual findings.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *The Court suggests that this shortcut is appropriate because Glossip,\n\f4                      GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                         Opinion of BARRETT, J.\n\n  I respectfully disagree. Smothermon\u2019s notes, taken dur-\ning a jailhouse interview of Sneed, consist of the words \u201con\nLithium?\u201d and \u201cDr. Trumpet?\u201d 3 App. 927. These notes are\nhardly clear, and there are competing explanations of what\nthey mean. Glossip, the Oklahoma attorney general, and\nthe Court argue that they demonstrate Smothermon\u2019s\nknowledge that Sneed had lied about Dr. Trombka\u2019s pre-\nscribing him lithium for bipolar disorder. See ante, at 18\u2013\n19, 26. The Van Treese amicus brief and JUSTICE THOMAS\ncontend that the notes instead reflect Sneed\u2019s account of a\nconversation with Glossip\u2019s lawyers, who had asked Sneed\nwhether he had received lithium from a \u201cDr. Trumpet.\u201d See\npost, at 11\u201313, and n. 3 (dissenting opinion). There are\nother possibilities too: For instance, perhaps Smothermon\nwas confused by references to \u201cDr. Trumpet\u201d and lithium\nbut never investigated the issue further. Neither Dr.\nTrombka\u2019s affidavit nor the attached medical information\nsheet nor any of the other record evidence discussed by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe attorney general, the Court-appointed amicus, and the OCCA \u201cunan-\nimously agree\u201d that the record is sufficiently developed. Ante, at 26. I\ndo not think that this assertion fairly captures the views of either the\namicus or the OCCA. When asked whether he \u201cobject[ed] to an eviden-\ntiary hearing,\u201d amicus\u2014whom we appointed to defend the judgment be-\nlow in this Court\u2014expressed doubt that he \u201cha[d] standing to object to\nan evidentiary hearing.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 107\u2013108. When pushed on the\npoint, he responded that the current record supports affirmance \u201cbased\non the evidence that [Glossip has] chosen to present and particularly\ngiven that he\u2019s now told you he wants the case decided on the current\nrecord [and] without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 109 (emphasis\nadded). In other words, amicus simply stated that the current record did\nnot support Glossip\u2019s claim\u2014not that the record was in any objective\nsense already fully developed. Moreover, the question here is not only\nwhether further factual development is warranted, but also which court\nshould find facts in the first instance. Amicus certainly did not concede\nthat this Court, rather than the OCCA, should play that role on this rec-\nord. As for the OCCA, its lack of explanation of the facts cannot be di-\nvorced from its erroneous view of Napue. Nothing in its opinion indicates\nwhat it would make of this record evidence if it confronted the relevant\nquestions under Napue.\n\f                 Cite as: 604 U.

It should have corrected the OCCA\u2019s\nmisstatements of federal law and vacated the judgment,\nleaving next steps\u2014including the decision whether to con-\nduct an evidentiary hearing\u2014to the OCCA.

Although\nGlossip won the support of Oklahoma\u2019s new attorney gen-\neral, he failed to persuade either body with authority to\ngrant him relief: The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) denied Glossip\u2019s application as both procedurally\ndeficient and nonmeritorious, and Oklahoma\u2019s Pardon and\nParole Board denied clemency. Because this Court lacks\nthe power to override these denials, that should have\nmarked the end of the road for Glossip. Instead, the Court\nstretches the law at every turn to rule in his favor. At the\nthreshold, it concocts federal jurisdiction by misreading the\ndecision below. On the merits, it finds a due process viola-\ntion based on patently immaterial testimony about a wit-\nness\u2019s medical condition.

OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                                I\n                               A\n  This case arises from the 1997 murder of Barry Van\nTreese, the owner of an Oklahoma City motel. Beginning\nin 1995, Glossip began working for Van Treese as the mo-\ntel\u2019s manager. 4 Tr. 182\u2013183 (May 14, 2004). In that ca-\npacity, Glossip unofficially hired 19-year-old Justin Sneed\nto be the motel\u2019s handyman. Glossip did not pay Sneed; in-\nstead, he let him live at the motel free of charge and occa-\nsionally bought him food. Id., at 43\u201344; 5 Tr. 67\u201370 (May\n17, 2004); 2 App. 644. In late 1996, Van Treese learned of\ndiscrepancies in Glossip\u2019s accounting suggesting that Glos-\nsip had been allowing guests to stay at the motel off the\nbooks and pocketing the money for himself. 4 Tr. 63, 68\u201371\n(May 14, 2004); 7 Tr. 35, 39\u201340, 45\u201349 (May 19, 2004); 11\nTr. 172\u2013173 (May 25, 2004). During a visit to the motel on\nJanuary 6, 1997, Van Treese confronted Glossip about this\nissue, and, having discovered unregistered guests staying\nat the motel, he threatened to report Glossip to the police\nunless Glossip produced receipts for their rooms. 8 Tr. 82\n(May 20, 2004).\n  Hours later, after Van Treese had gone to bed, Sneed en-\ntered Van Treese\u2019s motel room and repeatedly beat him\nover the head with a baseball bat. 2 App. 662\u2013664; 11 Tr.\n55 (May 25, 2004). Sneed left when he thought that he had\nkilled Van Treese, although the State\u2019s forensic pathologist\nlater determined that Van Treese had initially survived the\nattack, and died several hours later after slowly bleeding\nout. Id., at 55\u201357, 61; App. to Response to Petitioner\u2019s Succ.\nApplication for Post-Conviction Relief in No. PCD\u20132022\u2013\n819 (OCCA), Tr. of Glossip Police Interview 10 (Jan. 9,\n1997). Following his arrest, Sneed explained to police that\nGlossip had urged him to kill Van Treese. 2 App. 645, 660.\nAccording to Sneed, Glossip told him that they would both\nbe evicted if Glossip lost his job, and Glossip had promised\nto pay him $10,000 for carrying out the murder. 12 Tr. 95\u2013\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U.

Tr.\nof Glossip Police Interview 10 (Jan. 9, 1997). Glossip began\ndirecting a coverup. On Sneed\u2019s account, Glossip first told\nSneed to clean up glass shards from a window that Sneed\nhad broken during the attack. 12 Tr. 122 (May 26, 2004).\nGlossip also sent Sneed to retrieve about $4,000 in cash\nfrom Van Treese\u2019s car, and then to abandon the car in a\nnearby credit union parking lot. Id., at 124, 129. When\nSneed returned, the two divided the cash. Id., at 128\u2013129.\nThey then entered Van Treese\u2019s room, whereupon Glossip\ndirected Sneed to tape a shower curtain over the broken\nwindow and run the air conditioning at full blast to elimi-\nnate any odor. Id., at 130, 132. Glossip then dispatched\nSneed to buy plexiglass, which the pair installed over the\nbroken window on the morning of January 7. Tr. of Glossip\nPolice Interview 14\u201315 (Jan. 9, 1997); 4 Tr. 163\u2013165 (May\n14, 2004); 13 Tr. 126 (May 27, 2004). 1\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Despite its consistent theme that Sneed\u2019s testimony is too implausi-\n\nble to sustain Glossip\u2019s conviction, the majority feels the need to bolster\nits account by finding \u201cinconsisten[cies]\u201d in his testimony that are not\ngenuine. Ante, at 5, n. 1. There is no contradiction in Sneed\u2019s claims\nthat he committed the murder as part of a robbery and that he did so to\navoid being \u201c \u2018evicted if Glossip lost his job.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. At both of Glossip\u2019s\ntrials, Sneed consistently testified that Glossip proposed taking the cash\nVan Treese had with him and that Glossip told him that they would get\nevicted if he did not kill Van Treese. 12 Tr. 95\u201396, 98, 124 (May 26,\n2004); 6 Tr. 89\u201390, 95\u201396 (June 8, 1998). Contemporaneous evidence\nsupports both motivations. In his confession to police, Sneed stated that\nGlossip had proposed killing Van Treese and taking the cash that Van\nTreese had with him. 2 App. 675. And, two days after the murder, Glos-\nsip told police that Sneed had committed the murder in part because\n\u201c[h]e thought Barry [Van Treese] was going to throw him out in the\nstreet.\u201d Tr. of Glossip Police Interview 13 (Jan. 9, 1997). Nor did Sneed\never claim that \u201che did not know why Glossip wanted him to kill Van\nTreese.\u201d Ante, at 5, n. 1. He testified only that he did not know \u201cwhy Mr.\n\f4                      GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Glossip took additional steps to cover up the murder. He\ntold multiple witnesses that the window in Van Treese\u2019s\nroom was broken because two drunks had stayed there the\nnight before and smashed it in a brawl. 5 Tr. 85 (May 17,\n2004); 7 Tr. 64 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 46, 206 (May 21, 2004);\n11 Tr. 188\u2013189 (May 25, 2004). He told the housekeeper\nthat she did not need to clean the downstairs rooms\u2014in-\ncluding Van Treese\u2019s room. 8 Tr. 122\u2013123 (May 20, 2004).\nInstead, as Glossip explained to another employee and a\nmotel resident, he and Sneed would cover those rooms. 7\nTr. 64 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 49 (May 21, 2004). Glossip had\nnever taken such steps before. 8 Tr. 122\u2013123 (May 20,\n2004). He also told various witnesses that he had seen Van\nTreese alive and well around 7 o\u2019clock that morning. 4 Tr.\n99 (May 14, 2004); 7 Tr. 62\u201363 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 194\n(May 21, 2004); 11 Tr. 126\u2013127, 182\u2013183 (May 25, 2004).\n  That afternoon, the credit union called the motel to report\nthat Van Treese\u2019s car had been abandoned in its parking\nlot. 7 Tr. 70 (May 19, 2004). At that point, it became clear\nto the motel\u2019s staff that Van Treese was missing. Id., at 72\u2013\n74. Shortly thereafter, Glossip returned to the motel from\na shopping trip, during which he had made several large\npurchases, including an engagement ring for his girlfriend.\nId., at 74; 14 Tr. 41 (May 28, 2004). He then purported to\nsearch the rooms and surrounding area for Van Treese. 5\nTr. 97 (May 17, 2004); 9 Tr. 192\u2013193 (May 21, 2004); 11 Tr.\n185\u2013186, 190 (May 25, 2004). He even assured Van\nTreese\u2019s wife over the phone that everything was fine and\nthat he had seen Van Treese that morning. 4 Tr. 99\u2013100\n(May 14, 2004).\n  Glossip later repeated to a local police officer the story\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGlossip wanted to kill Mr. Van Treese on this particular night,\u201d because\n\u201c[e]very time that Mr. Van Treese showed up, [Glossip] was wanting me\nto kill him.\u201d 6 Tr. 89 (June 8, 1998) (emphasis added). As noted, Sneed\nclearly testified at the same trial that Glossip wanted Sneed to kill Van\nTreese so that they would not be evicted. Id., at 90.\n\f                 Cite as: 604 U.

Unpersuaded, the officer checked the room with the\nbroken window and discovered Van Treese\u2019s body. Id., at\n220, 224\u2013225; 11 Tr. 191, 194 (May 25, 2004). Glossip im-\nmediately told the officer that he suspected that Sneed had\nsomething to do with the murder, explaining that he had\nheard glass breaking and that Sneed had banged on his\ndoor, but he did not claim to know anything more. 9 Tr. 233\n(May 21, 2004).\n   Homicide detectives interviewed Glossip later that night.\nTr. of Glossip Police Interview 1, 10\u201311 (Jan. 8, 1997). He\ndenied knowing that Van Treese had been murdered before\nthe body was discovered. Id., at 70, 86. And, he vacillated\nbetween doubting that Sneed was involved and asserting\nthat he likely was. Id., at 27\u201328, 69\u201370.\n   On the morning of January 8, Glossip began to sell all his\npossessions, telling multiple witnesses that he would like to\nleave town. 8 Tr. 88 (May 20, 2004); 11 Tr. 199 (May 25,\n2004). On January 9, police picked up Glossip after he\nfailed to appear for a meeting with homicide detectives. 12\nTr. 7 (May 26, 2004). He had $1,757 in cash on his person\nand no explanation for how he\u2014living paycheck to\npaycheck and having made only $490 from selling his pos-\nsessions the previous day\u2014had so much cash. Id., at 12\u2013\n13; 14 Tr. 43\u201344 (May 28, 2004); 15 Tr. 17, 93 (June 1,\n2004).\n   Glossip sat for a second interview with homicide detec-\ntives later that day. Tr. of Glossip Police Interview 1 (Jan.\n9, 1997). This time, although continuing to deny that he\nhad ordered Sneed to kill Van Treese, Glossip admitted that\nSneed had told him about the murder just after committing\nit, and that he had instructed Sneed to clean up the glass\nand repair the window. Id., at 13\u201314, 36. Glossip also ad-\nmitted that Van Treese \u201cwas upset because the motel\nwasn\u2019t doing as well as it could.\u201d Id., at 32. When asked\n\f6                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhy he hid the murder, Glossip denied doing so to protect\nSneed. He said he covered up the murder instead to protect\nhimself, because he \u201cwas involved in it\u201d and risked losing\nhis girlfriend otherwise. Id., at 29\u201330.\n   During this interview, Glossip also tried to minimize his\ninvolvement in the crime by insisting that he had not gone\ninside Van Treese\u2019s hotel room after the attack. Id., at 18;\nsee also ante, at 2 (emphasizing this denial). At trial, how-\never, a motel resident testified that, on the morning of Jan-\nuary 7, Glossip had said that he and Sneed had been \u201cin the\nroom\u201d after the window was broken. 9 Tr. 120 (May 21,\n2004).\n   Police arrested Sneed five days later and charged him\nwith capital murder. 2 App. 644\u2013645. He had $1,680 in\ncash in his possession. 14 Tr. 12\u201318 (May 28, 2004). At\nfirst, Sneed denied involvement, claiming that his brother\nand Glossip had once discussed the idea but that it never\nwent beyond talk. 2 App. 655\u2013657. Later in the interview,\nhowever, Sneed confessed to murdering Van Treese at Glos-\nsip\u2019s instigation. Id., at 660, 664.\n                                B\n                                1\n   Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in 1998,\nbut the OCCA ordered a retrial based on ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel. 2001 OK CR 21, 29 P. 3d 597.\n   At his second trial in 2004, a jury convicted Glossip again,\nand the judge again sentenced him to death. Sneed testi-\nfied against Glossip during the guilt phase, as he had at the\nfirst trial. While Sneed was providing background infor-\nmation about himself at the outset of this testimony, the\nState\u2019s lead prosecutor, Connie Smothermon, asked him\nwhether he had received any \u201cprescription medication\u201d af-\nter being arrested. 12 Tr. 63\u201364 (May 26, 2004). Sneed\nresponded that he had briefly been prescribed \u201cLithium for\nsome reason, I don\u2019t know why. I never seen no psychiatrist\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

The matter did not come up again\nduring the trial.\n   It would not have been challenging for the parties to de-\nduce the reason for Sneed\u2019s lithium prescription. It is un-\ndisputed that lithium\u2019s sole medical purpose, both in 1997\nand today, is to treat bipolar disorder and other mental\nhealth disorders. See ante, at 18. Were there any doubt\nabout Sneed\u2019s condition, records long available to both sides\nresolve it. In 1997, Sneed underwent a pretrial competency\nevaluation with forensic psychologist Dr. Edith King. Dr.\nKing\u2019s report strongly suggested that although Sneed him-\nself may have been in denial, he was taking lithium to treat\nbipolar disorder or a similar condition. During his evalua-\ntion, Sneed asserted that he \u201cd[id] not think he ha[d] any\nserious mental problems.\u201d 2 App. 701. And, he reported he\nwas given the lithium, apparently by mistake, \u201cafter his\ntooth was pulled.\u201d Id., at 700. Dr. King felt otherwise. Con-\ncluding that Sneed qualified as a \u201cmentally ill person or a\nperson requiring treatment,\u201d ibid., she determined that he\nlikely had \u201can atypical mood swing disorder in his past\ncharacterized by \u2018ups and downs\u2019 including anger outburst.\u201d\nId., at 702. \u201cHis present medication [i.e., the lithium] is\nprobably helping him control his moods.\u201d Ibid.\n   The defense was well aware of this report before Glossip\u2019s\nsecond trial. In fact, on direct appeal of his first conviction,\nGlossip\u2019s appellate counsel had faulted his trial counsel for\nnot using Dr. King\u2019s report to show the jury that Sneed was\ntaking lithium to control his anger. 1 id., at 18. Neverthe-\nless, after the OCCA vacated his first conviction, Glossip\ndeclined to seek further pretrial discovery on the issue or\nraise it during his second trial.\n   After his second conviction and sentence, Glossip ignored\nthe lithium issue on direct appeal, instead raising a general\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge. The OCCA unani-\nmously rejected that challenge, finding that there was suf-\nficient evidence to convict and that the State had satisfied\n\f8                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nan additional state-law requirement for corroborative evi-\ndence where a conviction rests on accomplice testimony.\n2007 OK CR 12, \u00b6\u00b647\u201353, 157 P. 3d 143, 153\u2013154. Two\njudges dissented on different grounds but \u201cagree[d] with the\nmajority that the State presented a strong circumstantial\ncase against Glossip.\u201d Id., at 175 (Chapel, J.); see also ibid.\n(A. Johnson, J.).\n                              2\n   Glossip has spent the past two decades challenging his\nconviction and sentence through direct appeal, state and\nfederal collateral proceedings, and civil litigation under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Throughout that time,\nno court has \u201cdetermined error in [his] trial proceeding\u201d or\nfound that \u201cthere [has] been a showing of actual innocence.\u201d\n2023 OK CR 5, \u00b62, 529 P. 3d 218, 229 (Lumpkin, J., spe-\ncially concurring). And, for almost that entire duration, the\nOklahoma attorney general has steadfastly defended the\nverdict and sentence, insisting that the evidence the State\npresented in 1998 and 2004 has never \u201cbeen credibly rebut-\nted.\u201d 3 App. 769.\n   In 2022, as Glossip\u2019s execution date approached, a group\nof Oklahoma legislators opposed to his execution commis-\nsioned the law firm Reed Smith LLP to conduct an inde-\npendent investigation of his case. The firm, which is pub-\nlicly committed to \u201cfighting the death penalty,\u201d id., at 709,\nn. 3 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), is-\nsued a final report expressing \u201cgrave doubt as to the integ-\nrity of Glossip\u2019s murder conviction and death sentence,\u201d In-\ndependent Investigation of State v. Richard E. Glossip 6\n(June 7, 2022) (Reed Smith Report). The attorney general\nvigorously disagreed. In subsequent post-conviction filings,\nthe State asserted that the report was \u201cbuilt on assump-\ntions, half-truths, and (in some cases) outright falsehoods,\u201d\n3 App. 769, and criticized its findings at length, see id., at\n754\u2013769.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            9\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   In response to the Reed Smith Report, the attorney gen-\neral\u2019s office released all its files from the case to Glossip,\nexcept for one box of attorney work product. Based on\nthis information, Glossip filed a fourth motion for post-\nconviction relief in the OCCA, raising two overarching\nclaims. The first claim was that the State violated Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by withholding evidence\nthat Sneed considered recanting his original testimony be-\nfore the second trial. The second claim was that Smother-\nmon, the lead prosecutor, committed misconduct and vio-\nlated the rule of sequestration (which prohibits witnesses\nfrom hearing other witnesses\u2019 testimony) during trial. Af-\nter the State\u2019s forensic pathologist testified that there was\nevidence Sneed used a knife in addition to the bat during\nthe murder, Smothermon sent a memorandum to Sneed\u2019s\nattorney highlighting ways in which this testimony was\nhard to square with some of Sneed\u2019s earlier statements.\nGlossip thus claimed Smothermon violated the rule of se-\nquestration by conveying witness statements for the pur-\npose of coaching Sneed into altering his testimony to fit the\nforensic evidence. Attorney General John O\u2019Connor op-\nposed the application, urging the OCCA not to be cowed by\nthe ongoing \u201cpublic relations campaign\u201d to \u201cfalsely\u201d present\nGlossip as \u201cinnocent.\u201d 3 App. 717.\n   The OCCA unanimously denied the application. Under\nOklahoma\u2019s Post-Conviction Procedure Act (PCPA), Glos-\nsip\u2019s post-conviction application could not proceed unless he\ncould show (1) that the \u201cfactual basis for the claim\u201d was pre-\nviously unavailable and (2) that, but for the alleged error,\nno reasonable jury would have convicted him or sentenced\nhim to death. Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, \u00a71089(D)(8)(b) (2024).\nThe OCCA held that both claims failed the first require-\nment because they were not based on new information. It\nalso held that Glossip\u2019s claims failed on the merits.\n   As to the recantation claim, the OCCA held that Glossip\u2019s\nfirst claim was procedurally barred because the defense\n\f10                      GLOSSIP v.

In fact, one of Glossip\u2019s attor-\nneys had even visited Sneed before trial in an effort to per-\nsuade him not to testify. Ibid. On the merits, there was \u201cno\nevidence that Sneed had any desire to recant or change his\ntestimony.\u201d Id., at 776.

Sneed was reluctant to testify because\nhe wanted to obtain a better plea deal or to avoid the dis-\nruption to his life that testifying would cause. Id., at 776. 2\n  Turning to the sequestration claim, the OCCA pointed\nout that Smothermon had acknowledged at trial that she\nhad spoken with Sneed\u2019s counsel, so the claim likewise\nlacked a new factual basis. Id., at 780; see 12 Tr. 107\u2013108\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The majority points to a letter from Sneed to his attorney in which\n\nSneed raised the prospect of \u201c \u2018 \u201crecanting\u201d \u2019 \u201d his trial testimony. Ante,\nat 8 (quoting 3 App. 815). But, in two subsequent interviews with Reed\nSmith attorneys, Sneed made clear that, although he wanted to avoid\ntestifying again if possible, he continued to stand by the truth of his ear-\nlier testimony:\n   \u201c[REED SMITH ATTORNEY]: Yeah. Well, I think the bottom line\nhere, the most important things that we needed to clarify was like when\nyou\u2019re talking about recanting, you\u2019re not talking about changing your\nstory about what happened. Have you ever indicated to anybody that\nyou ever wanted to change your story about what happened?\n   \u201cJUSTIN SNEED: No, sir. I have not ever indicated that I wanted to\nchange the truth of him applying pressure to me.\u201d App. to Response to\nPetitioner\u2019s Succ.

Sneed has never on\nany occasion indicated that his testimony that Glossip directed him to\nkill Van Treese was false, see 3 App. 724\u2013725, and the majority cites no\nsuch occasion. The best explanation for Sneed\u2019s letter, and the one that\nthe OCCA credited as factual, is thus that Sneed, an eighth-grade drop-\nout, used the phrase \u201crecanting my testimony\u201d imprecisely to mean \u201cre-\nfuse to testify.\u201d Id., at 725, 776.\n\f                 Cite as: 604 U.

On the merits, the court held that Okla-\nhoma\u2019s sequestration statute does not prohibit counsel from\ndiscussing with a witness other witnesses\u2019 testimony. 3\nApp. 781.

And, nothing in\nSmothermon\u2019s memorandum indicates she was encourag-\ning Sneed to lie. 3 App. 781\u2013782.\n                               3\n   In January 2023, Gentner Drummond became Okla-\nhoma\u2019s attorney general. During his first month in office,\nDrummond released the final box of evidence (Box 8) to\nGlossip. He also appointed Rex Duncan, a personal friend\nand campaign donor, as independent counsel to reexamine\nthe legitimacy of Glossip\u2019s conviction.\n   Among the materials released in Box 8 were handwritten\nnotes taken by Smothermon and her co-counsel Gary Ack-\nley during a 2003 meeting between them, Sneed, and\nSneed\u2019s attorney.\n   Glossip\u2019s counsel quickly seized on Smothermon\u2019s notes.\nIn the top left corner of the notes, Smothermon had written\n\u201con Lithium?\u201d and \u201cDr Trumpet?\u201d See Figure 1, infra. Ac-\ncording to Glossip\u2019s counsel, these phrases meant that\nSneed had admitted during the meeting that he had been\nprescribed lithium by Dr. Lawrence Trombka, the psychia-\ntrist at the Oklahoma County Jail.\n\f12                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    Smothermon and Ackley disagree with this interpreta-\ntion. They assert before this Court that, during the meet-\ning, Sneed recounted two interviews that he previously had\nwith members of Glossip\u2019s defense team. In context,\nSmothermon\u2019s notes simply record that Sneed told her that\nGlossip\u2019s defense team had asked him about his use of lith-\nium and about \u201cDr Trumpet.\u201d The prosecutors claim that\nthis fact is apparent from the other notes on the page and\nfrom Ackley\u2019s notes, both of which refer to details of these\nprior interviews. Ackley\u2019s notes also highlight the phrase\n\u201c \u2018tooth pulled.\u2019 \u201d 3 App. 940. The prosecutors\u2019 interpreta-\ntion of their own notes thus suggests that Sneed recounted\nthat he had responded to questions about lithium and Dr.\nTrombka with his earlier story that he was prescribed lith-\nium in error after having his tooth pulled. This interpreta-\ntion is explained at great length by the Van Treese family\u2019s\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Smothermon\u2019s handwritten notes. See 3 App. 927.\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U.

According to the notes above the line, Sneed\u2019s first visi-\ntors were \u201cwomen,\u201d one of whom was an investigator (\u201cinvest.\u201d) who may\nhave been heavy set (\u201cheavy set?\u201d).

See 3 App. 729\u2013730. At this meeting, Sneed\n\u201c \u2018signed releases for juvenile, jail, prison and criminal records,\u2019 \u201d id., at\n729, which corresponds to the \u201cwaiver for records\u201d mentioned in\nSmothermon\u2019s notes. Sneed later wrote a letter to Cooper to ensure that\nshe received information about his participation in a \u201cvo-tech program,\u201d\nid., at 730, which corresponds to the reference to \u201cGED VoTech.\u201d\n   According to Smothermon\u2019s notes below the line, Sneed\u2019s second visit\nwas from a \u201cman\u201d named \u201cBurch\u201d who tried to \u201ccon [him] out\u201d of giving\n\u201ctestimony\u201d against Glossip.

Burch told Sneed \u201c \u2018he didn\u2019t\nhave to testify\u2019 \u201d in Glossip\u2019s second trial, and (in line with Smothermon\u2019s\nnotes) gave Sneed a case, State v. Dyer, 2001 OK CR 31, 34 P. 3d 652,\nholding that the State could not renege on a plea agreement for refusing\nto testify at a codefendant\u2019s second trial. 3 App. 731\u2013732.\n\f14                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nframed the notes as new evidence of Sneed\u2019s previously un-\nknown bipolar disorder. Glossip attached an affidavit from\nDr. Trombka stating that he was the only person who would\nhave prescribed lithium while Sneed was in jail. Glossip\nalso attached what appears to be a jail record indicating\nthat Sneed has bipolar disorder. He argued that the State\u2019s\nrefusal to produce these notes before trial violated Brady,\non the theory that he could have used Sneed\u2019s condition to\nimpeach his testimony.\n   At the same time, Glossip recognized that he would need\nadditional evidence to prove his theory. Together with his\napplication, Glossip also filed a motion for an evidentiary\nhearing, in which he sought to call Smothermon and Ackley\nas witnesses. Motion for Evidentiary Hearing in No. PCD\u2013\n2023\u2013267 (OCCA), p. 2. Glossip explained in the motion\nthat \u201cthe resolution\u201d of his Brady claim \u201cturns in part on\ninterpretation of prosecutors\u2019 notes.\u201d Motion for Eviden-\ntiary Hearing, at 1. \u201cWithout their testimony,\u201d he acknowl-\nedged, \u201cany finding about what they meant or what the at-\ntorneys did or did not know when they wrote them would\nbe speculation.\u201d Id., at 1\u20132.\n   Independent Counsel Duncan, on the other hand, deter-\nmined that no further evidence was needed. Duncan re-\nleased his final report shortly after Glossip filed his fifth\napplication. He agreed that the State violated Glossip\u2019s\nBrady rights and asserted that Smothermon\u2019s failure to cor-\nrect Sneed\u2019s testimony amounted to a due process violation\nunder Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264 (1959). Duncan\nbased his conclusions on the speculation that \u201cseasoned\ncapital homicide prosecutors . . . could be expected\u201d to know\nthat \u201cTrumpet\u201d referred to Dr. Trombka and that Dr.\nTrombka was the psychiatrist at the Oklahoma County\nJail.

Instead, he\ndiscussed the matter with her only once, during a 3-minute\nphone call. App. to Brief for Victim Family Members as\nAmici Curiae 31a. Worse, he gave Smothermon no chance\nto review the decades-old notes before asking her to explain\nthem during the brief call. Ibid. Drummond was likewise\nuninterested in hearing from the attorney he and Duncan\nwere impugning.        Following Duncan\u2019s report, both\nSmothermon and the Van Treese family contacted Drum-\nmond\u2019s office to request that Drummond speak with\nSmothermon about the notes. Id., at 6a\u20137a, 71a. Their\npleas were ignored. 4\n  At the attorney general\u2019s behest, the State supported\nGlossip\u2019s post-conviction application.     It argued that\nSmothermon\u2019s notes proved that the prosecutors violated\nBrady and Napue, and that Glossip was entitled to relief\nunder the State\u2019s PCPA. It neglected to address, however,\nthe stringent limitations that the PCPA imposes on such\nsubsequent applications. See \u00a71089(D)(8)(b).\n  The OCCA unanimously denied Glossip\u2019s fifth post-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority insists that Smothermon had a fair opportunity to ex-\n\nplain her notes because she met once with attorneys at the Reed Smith\nlaw firm and had an earlier, longer phone call with Duncan. Ante, at 25\u2013\n26. But, the Reed Smith meeting occurred before the release of Box 8.\nSee Reed Smith Report 80, n. 321 (noting that the Reed Smith meeting\noccurred in May 2022, eight months before Box 8 was released in Janu-\nary 2023). And\u2014by his own admission\u2014Duncan \u201cforgot to ask\u201d\nSmothermon about \u201cDr. Larry Trombka\u201d during his earlier, longer phone\ncall. App. to Brief for Victim Family Members as Amici Curiae 32a. The\nmajority also faults Smothermon for not having an explanation ready\nduring the 3-minute phone call. Ante, at 25\u201326. But, without giving\nSmothermon an opportunity to review the notes, it was unreasonable to\nexpect her instantaneously to recall their meaning 20 years later.\n\f16                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nconviction application. The court first held that Glossip had\nnot satisfied either requirement of \u00a71089(D)(8)(b), and thus\nthat the Brady and Napue claims were procedurally barred.\n529 P. 3d, at 226. The OCCA then held that both claims\nalso failed on the merits. No Brady violation occurred, the\ncourt explained, because Sneed\u2019s 1997 pretrial competency\nreport already informed the defense of Sneed\u2019s prescription\nand condition. The OCCA determined that defense counsel\nhad likely made a strategic decision not to base a defense\non them. 529 P. 3d, at 226. Nor was there any Napue vio-\nlation, according to the court, because Sneed\u2019s testimony\n\u201cwas not clearly false\u201d and, in any event, was not material\ngiven defense counsel\u2019s choice not to raise Sneed\u2019s condi-\ntion. 529 P. 3d, at 226\u2013227. After the OCCA issued its de-\ncision, Oklahoma\u2019s Pardon and Parole Board denied clem-\nency.\n                               II\n   As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review this\ncase. \u201cThis Court from the time of its foundation has ad-\nhered to the principle that it will not review judgments of\nstate courts that rest on adequate and independent state\ngrounds.\u201d Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125 (1945). \u201cBe-\ncause this Court has no power to review a state law deter-\nmination that is sufficient to support the judgment, resolu-\ntion of any independent federal ground for the decision\ncould not affect the judgment and would therefore be advi-\nsory.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991).\nThus, on direct review of a state-court judgment, the pres-\nence of an adequate and independent state ground imposes\na \u201cjurisdictional\u201d limitation. Ibid. The decision below rests\non such grounds, and the majority concludes otherwise only\nby grossly mischaracterizing the state court\u2019s analysis.\n                              A\n     The PCPA authorizes a criminal defendant to collaterally\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

But,\ngiven the extraordinary nature of collateral challenges, the\nstatute also imposes a variety of restrictions on relief. In\ncapital cases, the applicant must establish not just a consti-\ntutional violation, but also, among other requirements, that\nhis claim \u201ccould not have been raised in a direct appeal\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe outcome of the trial would have been different but\nfor the errors or that the defendant is factually innocent.\u201d\n\u00a71089(C).\n   The PCPA further bars subsequent applications for relief,\nsuch as Glossip\u2019s, unless the applicant satisfies two addi-\ntional requirements. As mentioned, the applicant must\nshow that \u201cthe factual basis for the claim\u201d was not previ-\nously \u201cascertainable through the exercise of reasonable dil-\nigence.\u201d \u00a71089(D)(8)(b)(1). And, the applicant must demon-\nstrate that \u201cthe facts underlying the claim\u201d would, if proved,\n\u201cestablish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the\nalleged error, no reasonable fact finder would have found\nthe applicant guilty of the underlying offense or would have\nrendered the penalty of death.\u201d \u00a71089(D)(8)(b)(2). These\ntwo necessary conditions\u2014the diligence and actual-\ninnocence requirements\u2014closely mirror limits that the An-\ntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA) imposes on successive federal habeas petitions.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b)(2)(B); Davison v. State, 2023 OK\nCR 11, \u00b69, n. 1, 531 P. 3d 649, 651, n. 1.\n   As with other state-law requirements, the PCPA\u2019s bar on\nsubsequent applications ordinarily will constitute an ade-\nquate and independent state ground precluding our review.\nIt is independent because its application does not \u201cdepend\nupon a federal constitutional ruling on the merits.\u201d Stewart\nv. Smith, 536 U. S. 856, 860 (2002) (per curiam). It is ade-\nquate as a general matter because States have no constitu-\ntional obligation to create \u201ccollateral proceedings\u201d in the\nfirst place. Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10 (1989)\n\f18                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(plurality opinion). And, it is adequate in particular cases\nso long as the OCCA\u2019s decision to rely on it is not \u201cso un-\nfounded\u201d in existing law or the record \u201cas to be essentially\narbitrary.\u201d Cruz v. Arizona, 598 U. S. 17, 26 (2023) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). A decision will be inade-\nquate on this basis only in \u201cthe rarest of situations.\u201d Ibid.\n  Here, the OCCA held that the PCPA barred Glossip\u2019s ap-\nplication twice over because he failed to meet either the dil-\nigence or actual-innocence requirements. 529 P. 3d, at 226.\nThe OCCA properly grounded these conclusions in its anal-\nysis of the record: It explained that because Glossip had\nbeen aware of Sneed\u2019s condition and lithium prescription\nsince 1997, with \u201creasonable diligence\u201d the Napue violation\n\u201ccould have been presented previously.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226.\nLikewise, Glossip could not establish that, but for the al-\nleged Napue violation, \u201cno reasonable fact finder\u201d would\nhave convicted him. 529 P. 3d, at 226. Correcting Sneed\u2019s\ntestimony simply would have furnished the defense with\nadditional impeachment evidence that did not directly con-\ntradict the State\u2019s basic theory. But, \u201cevidence of factual\ninnocence must be more than that which merely tends to\ndiscredit or impeach a witness.\u201d Id., at 225 (collecting\ncases). The OCCA\u2019s reliance on the PCPA thus was both an\nadequate basis for its judgment and independent of federal\nlaw, leaving us without jurisdiction. Glossip\u2019s case should\nend here.\n                                B\n  The majority evades this straightforward conclusion by\ninventing a federal holding that the OCCA never made. Be-\nfore applying the PCPA\u2019s bar on subsequent applications,\nthe majority contends, the OCCA first addressed the State\u2019s\n\u201cconfession of Napue error.\u201d Ante, at 13. The OCCA then\nfound this confession to be \u201c \u2018not based in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 14 (quoting 529 P. 3d, at 226). Thus, the majority con-\ncludes, the OCCA premised its application of the PCPA\u2019s\n\f                     Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                   19\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbar on an \u201cantecedent holding\u201d of \u201cfederal law,\u201d which we\nhave jurisdiction to review. Ante, at 13. This theory mis-\nstates the decision below and defies logic.\n   As the OCCA recognized (and the majority does not), the\nState did not merely confess to a Napue violation; it \u201ccon-\ncede[d] that [Sneed\u2019s] alleged false testimony combined\nwith other unspecified cumulative errors warrant post-\nconviction relief.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226 (emphasis added). A\nfederal claim can warrant post-conviction relief under the\nPCPA only if the applicant meets the PCPA\u2019s additional re-\nquirements. See \u00a71089(D)(4). The State partly recognized\nas much, expressly acknowledging that, \u201c[t]o obtain post-\nconviction relief, Glossip needs to show\u201d that he satisfies\nthe requirements of \u201c\u00a71089(C).\u201d 3 App. 976. The State\ntherefore argued that the alleged Napue violation met those\nrequirements\u2014namely, that the violation \u201ccould not have\nbeen asserted in a direct appeal,\u201d and that \u201cthe result of the\ntrial\u201d likely would not \u201chave been the same but for\u201d the Na-\npue violation and cumulative errors. 3 App. 977\u2013978.\n   The OCCA properly concluded that this argument\nsuffered a threshold defect: It ignored the PCPA\u2019s addi-\ntional requirements for \u201csubsequent application[s] for post-\nconviction relief \u201d under \u00a71089(D). Beyond showing that he\nmet the \u00a71089(C) requirements, Glossip also had to show\nhe satisfied \u00a71089(D)\u2019s diligence and actual-innocence re-\nquirements. \u00a71089(D)(8)(b). Yet, the State never addressed\nthose prerequisites. The OCCA thus held that Oklahoma\u2019s\n\u201cconcession alone cannot overcome the limitations on suc-\ncessive post-conviction review.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226 (citing\n\u00a71089(D)(8)). 5 Because the State\u2019s concession that the cir-\ncumstances \u201cwarrant post-conviction relief \u201d overlooked\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority claims that the OCCA could not have meant to rely on\n\n\u00a71089(D) because the State \u201cexpressly attempted to waive\u201d the require-\nments of that provision. Ante, at 16. The State did no such thing. In its\nresponse to Glossip\u2019s application, the State of Oklahoma contended that,\n\f20                      GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthese additional state-law requirements, the OCCA cor-\nrectly observed that the State\u2019s assertion was \u201cnot based in\nlaw or fact.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226. And, as the OCCA\u2019s\n\u00a71089(D) citation makes clear, the court was referring to\nOklahoma law, not federal law.\n  The structure of the OCCA\u2019s analysis reinforces this con-\nclusion. The relevant portion of the opinion reads as fol-\nlows:\n       \u201c\u00b625 Glossip claims that the State failed to disclose\n     evidence of Justin Sneed\u2019s mental health treatment\n     and that Sneed lied about his mental health treatment\n     to the jury. Though the State in its response now con-\n     cedes that this alleged false testimony combined with\n     other unspecified cumulative errors warrant post-\n     conviction relief, the concession alone cannot overcome\n     the limitations on successive post-conviction review.\n     See 22 O.S.Supp.2022, \u00a71089(D)(8). The State\u2019s con-\n     cession is not based in law or fact.\n       \u201c\u00b626 This issue is one that could have been presented\n     previously, because the factual basis for the claim was\n     ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable dili-\n     gence, and the facts are not sufficient to establish by\n     clear and convincing evidence that, but for the alleged\n     error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the\n     applicant guilty of the underlying offense or would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201c[t]o obtain post-conviction relief, Glossip needs to show\u201d he satisfies the\nPCPA. 3 App. 976 (citing \u00a71089(C)). It then offered an argument that\nGlossip had satisfied the PCPA\u2019s requirements. Id., at 976\u2013978. Such\nan argument is distinct from a \u201cwaiver,\u201d which \u201cis the voluntary and in-\ntentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d Price v. Zhang, 2022 OK 95,\n\u00b619, 521 P. 3d 795, 799\u2013800. Regardless, even if the State had purported\nto waive \u00a71089(D), the OCCA nonetheless explicitly applied it. 529 P. 3d,\nat 226 (citing \u00a71089(D)(8)). Perhaps the majority thinks that ruling is\ntoo harsh\u2014even though AEDPA\u2019s analogous limitations on successive\nfederal habeas petitions are often, if not always, unwaivable. See Burton\nv. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 157 (2007) (per curiam). But, the harshness of\nsuch a ruling would not make it any less independent of federal law.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

This structure leaves no doubt that\n\u00a71089(D)\u2019s requirements are why the State\u2019s concession\nfailed: The application of \u00a71089(D) in paragraph 26 ex-\nplained the immediately preceding statement that the\n\u201cState\u2019s concession is not based in law or fact.\u201d The merits\ndiscussion in paragraph 28 was a follow-on, alternative\nholding.\n   The majority\u2019s alternative interpretation is incoherent.\nAccording to the Court, the OCCA\u2019s analysis proceeded as\nfollows: First, the court asserted that the State\u2019s \u201cconces-\nsion alone cannot overcome the limitations on successive\npost-conviction review,\u201d and expressly cited \u00a71089(D)\u2019s dili-\ngence and actual-innocence requirements. Ibid. Second,\nthe OCCA without explanation switched\u2014in the very next\nsentence\u2014to the merits and decided the Napue question in\na single, conclusory assertion that the \u201cState\u2019s concession is\nnot based in law or fact.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226. Third, after\nsummarily deciding the merits of a federal constitutional\nclaim, the OCCA toggled back to the procedural bar in the\nvery next paragraph to explain why Glossip failed to meet\nthe PCPA\u2019s procedural requirements. Fourth and finally,\nthe OCCA circled around to spell out its \u201cantecedent\u201d Na-\npue merits holding. Ante, at 13. This reading is as convo-\nluted and implausible as it sounds. If \u201cthe only reason\u201d\n\f22                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71089(D) applied had been because the Napue claim inde-\npendently failed on the merits, there would have been no\npoint in discussing \u00a71089(D) in the first place. Ante, at 14.\n   Finally, the majority cannot fall back on Michigan v.\nLong, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), which establishes a presump-\ntion that a state court has based its decision on federal law\nwhen it is \u201cinsufficiently \u2018clear from the face of the opinion\u2019 \u201d\nthat the court meant to rely on an independent state-law\nground. Ante, at 15 (quoting 463 U. S., at 1040\u20131041).\nHere, the OCCA expressly held that \u00a71089(D) barred any\nrelief based on Napue. 529 P. 3d, at 226. That leaves the\n\u201cface of the opinion\u201d as \u201cclear\u201d as it gets. Long, 463 U. S.,\nat 1041. The majority\u2019s tortured reading of the OCCA\u2019s\n\u201claw or fact\u201d phrase is too farfetched to undermine the force\nof that \u201cplain statement\u201d that state law resolved the case.\nIbid.\n                              C\n   Unable to make a plausible case from the four corners of\nthe opinion below, the majority attempts to bolster its read-\ning by relying on \u201cOklahoma precedent involving confes-\nsions of error.\u201d Ante, at 14. In particular, in a series of de-\ncisions issued between 54 and 106 years ago, the OCCA\nheld that a confession of error must have \u201ca basis in the law\nand in the record\u201d to be sustained. Ante, 14\u201315, and n. 6.\nAccording to the majority, these decisions establish that\nwhenever the State identifies that a federal constitutional\nerror occurred, all independent legal grounds for sustaining\nthe judgment disappear. Ante, at 14\u201315.\n   We disapproved of the majority\u2019s method of finding juris-\ndiction in Long. There, we decided that, as a general mat-\nter, we would no longer \u201cdecide issues of state law that go\nbeyond the opinion that we review\u201d to determine whether a\njudgment rests on an adequate and independent state\nground. 463 U. S., at 1040. We adopted this practice be-\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            23\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncause the \u201cprocess of examining state law\u201d ourselves \u201cre-\nquires us to interpret state laws with which we are gener-\nally unfamiliar, and which often . . . have not been dis-\ncussed at length by the parties.\u201d Id., at 1039. That concern\nis on full display here: Not a single merits brief in this case\ncites any of the decisions invoked by the majority for its\ngrand theory of confessions of error under Oklahoma law;\nthe majority developed it entirely sua sponte. Despite\nwrapping itself in the mantle of Long, the majority disre-\ngards one of its central teachings.\n   If we are to look at other OCCA decisions, I would start\nwith history that is more recent and more on point. In re-\nsponse to Glossip\u2019s fourth application for post-conviction re-\nlief, the State explicitly \u201cwaive[d] its right to argue the\nclaims within this . . . application are waived\u201d under the\nPCPA. 3 App. 717\u2013718. But, the OCCA refused to accept\nthe waiver, holding that \u201c[t]his Court alone will determine\nwhether the rules of this Court should be abandoned.\u201d Id.,\nat 775; see also ante, at 9. The OCCA thus made clear that\nit would apply the PCPA\u2019s procedural bars whether the\nState wanted it to or not. It makes no sense to say, just\nmonths later\u2014and in the same case\u2014that the OCCA re-\nversed course without explanation and decided that\n\u00a71089(D) becomes irrelevant when the State supports the\napplicant\u2019s claim for relief (while at the same time holding\nthat \u00a71089(D) applies). See ante, at 16. It should go with-\nout saying that a decision issued five months before the de-\ncision below in Glossip\u2019s own case sheds far more light on\nwhat the OCCA meant than decisions issued in different\ncases a century ago.\n   In any event, the majority vastly overreads the case law\nit cites. The decisions establish the modest point that a con-\nfession of error does not automatically entitle a defendant\nto relief; rather, the OCCA will independently \u201cexamine the\nrecord\u201d to ensure that the confession is \u201cwell founded in\nlaw.\u201d Raymer v. State, 27 Okla. Crim. 398, 228 P. 500\n\f24                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(1924) (syllabus by the court); see ante, at 14\u201315, and n. 6.\nOf course, a confession that post-conviction relief is war-\nranted is not well founded if the PCPA bars relief. And,\nthose decisions nowhere hold that procedural bars that\nmight render an error harmless become irrelevant when-\never the State confesses error.\n   This Court follows the same rule, derived from early Eng-\nlish practice, that it must \u201cexamine independently\u201d confes-\nsions of error before reversing. Young v. United States, 315\nU. S. 257, 258\u2013259 (1942) (citing Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr.\n2527, 2551, 98 Eng. Rep. 327, 340\u2013341 (K. B. 1770)). And,\nthis Court applies independent bars to relief even when the\nGovernment confesses error. See, e.g., Grzegorczyk v.\nUnited States, 597 U. S. ___ (2022) (statement of\nKAVANAUGH, J., joined by ROBERTS, C. J., and THOMAS,\nALITO, and BARRETT, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari)\n(rejecting the Government\u2019s confession of error and request\nfor vacatur of the judgment below because the defendant\u2019s\nguilty plea waived his claim). Yet, the majority here foists\nupon Oklahoma essentially the opposite rule by requiring\nreversal based on errors a court has not independently\nruled to be reversible. There is no basis to infer from the\nOCCA\u2019s duty to independently examine confessions of error\nthat it will ignore independent grounds for upholding a con-\nviction.\n   The Court\u2019s detour into state-law materials whose con-\nsideration Long strongly discouraged does nothing to un-\ndermine the straightforward conclusion that the decision\nbelow invoked \u00a71089(D)\u2019s procedural bar as a hurdle inde-\npendent of the Napue claim\u2019s merits. That adequate and\nindependent state ground bars our review of this case.\n                             III\n  Even if we had jurisdiction, we could not grant relief be-\ncause Glossip has failed to show that he is entitled to a\nhearing on the merits of his Napue claim.\n\f                      Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)                      25\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Napue establishes that \u201ca State may not knowingly use\nfalse evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted\nconviction.\u201d 360 U. S., at 269. If a witness gives false tes-\ntimony, which the prosecutor knows to be false but fails to\ncorrect, then a new trial is warranted if there is \u201cany rea-\nsonable likelihood\u201d that the false testimony could \u201chave af-\nfected the judgment of the jury.\u201d Id., at 270\u2013271. A Napue\nclaim therefore requires three elements: falsity, prosecuto-\nrial knowledge, and materiality. Here, the OCCA correctly\nheld, at minimum, that the Napue claim fails the material-\nity requirement. 6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Because the OCCA did not address whether the prosecutors knew\n\nthat Sneed\u2019s testimony was false, our review of the knowledge element\nis especially improper. The rule that \u201cwe are a court of review, not of\nfirst view,\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005), applies\nwith special force to such a fact-intensive question. The OCCA, which\nhas resolved two direct appeals and five post-conviction applications over\ntwo decades of appeals in this case, is far more steeped in the relevant\nfacts than this Court. And, it is at least entitled to apply Oklahoma\u2019s\nreticulated post-conviction evidentiary standards in the first instance.\nSee Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, \u00a71089(D)(4)(a)(1); OCCA Rule 9.7(D) (2024). The\nmajority\u2019s analysis well illustrates our comparative disadvantage, as it\noverreads silence and ignores explicit contrary evidence in an effort to\nleap across its inferential gaps. For example, Smothermon\u2019s notes say\nnothing about bipolar disorder or psychiatry. So, even if Sneed said Dr.\nTrombka prescribed the lithium, that is no justification for inferring that\nhe communicated the reason for the prescription or the fact that Dr.\nTrombka is a psychiatrist. Further, we cannot assume that Smothermon\nalready knew who Dr. Trombka was at the time of the meeting. In fact,\nthe evidence suggests the opposite; Smothermon clearly did not under-\nstand to whom Sneed was referring given that she mistook his name for\n\u201cTrumpet?\u201d See Figure 1, supra. Finally, the Court overlooks the affi-\ndavit submitted by Glossip from Gary Ackley. It attests that, according\nto Ackley\u2019s contemporaneous notes of the meeting, Sneed said something\nabout his \u201c \u2018tooth\u2019 \u201d being \u201c \u2018pulled,\u2019 \u201d 3 App. 940, which is how he said he\nwas mistakenly prescribed lithium in Dr. King\u2019s report, see 2 id., at 700.\nAckley also did \u201cnot recall knowing or discussing with anyone that Justin\nSneed was on lithium at any time as treatment for bipolar disorder.\u201d 3\nid., at 940.\n\f26                     GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                                 A\n   The OCCA held that Sneed\u2019s allegedly false statements\u2014\nthat he had \u201cnever seen\u201d a psychiatrist and did not \u201cknow\nwhy\u201d he was given lithium\u2014were not material because the\ndefense already had reason to know about Sneed\u2019s condition\nbut made a strategic decision not to make an issue of it. 529\nP. 3d, at 226\u2013227. That holding is correct.\n   The \u201ctouchstone of due process analysis in cases of al-\nleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial.\u201d\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 219 (1982). \u201cEven in cases\nof egregious prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d we have granted re-\nlief \u201conly when the tainted evidence was material to the\ncase.\u201d Id., at 220, n. 10. To that end, the proper inquiry is\nwhether \u201c \u2018the false testimony\u2019 \u201d could have \u201c \u2018affected the\njudgment of the jury.\u2019 \u201d Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S.\n150, 154 (1972) (emphasis added); see also Napue, 360\nU. S., at 269 (due process violation occurs where the State\n\u201cuse[s] false evidence . . . to obtain a tainted conviction\u201d).\n   There is no reasonable likelihood that Sneed\u2019s challenged\ntestimony changed the jury\u2019s verdict, because it did not bear\non any contested issue. As early as 1997, the defense knew\nthat Sneed likely suffered from an \u201catypical mood swing\ndisorder\u201d that involved \u201canger outburst[s],\u201d and that his\nlithium prescription helped to treat it. 2 App. 699\u2013700,\n702\u2013703; see also ante, at 18 (agreeing that \u201cGlossip had\naccess\u201d to Sneed\u2019s pretrial competency report). On direct\nappeal from his first conviction, Glossip\u2019s counsel identified\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   The majority dismisses the significance of Sneed\u2019s \u201ctooth pulled\u201d com-\nment on the ground that Ackley \u201cknew lithium was not a pain medica-\ntion.\u201d Ante, at 19, n. 8. But, whether or not Sneed in fact received lith-\nium in connection with his tooth being pulled, the fact that Sneed said\nsomething to that effect strongly undermines the supposedly \u201cstraight-\nforward inference . . . that Sneed told Smothermon that Dr. Trombka had\nprescribed him the lithium.\u201d Ante, at 18\u201319. Sneed\u2019s disputed testimony\nis not that he received lithium to treat a toothache; it is that he had\n\u201cnever seen\u201d a psychiatrist and did not \u201cknow why\u201d he was given lithium.\n12 Tr. 64 (May 26, 2004).\n\f                   Cite as: 604 U.

Given defense coun-\nsel\u2019s awareness of the pretrial competency report, this\nchoice must have been a conscious one. Perhaps, as the\nOCCA suggested, the defense was concerned that highlight-\ning \u201cSneed\u2019s mental health\u201d could have the counterproduc-\ntive effect of \u201cshowing that he was mentally vulnerable to\nGlossip\u2019s manipulation and control.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 226. Or,\nperhaps the defense believed it would not be credible to ar-\ngue that Sneed acted on impulse in a manic state, given\nother witnesses\u2019 testimony that Sneed possessed a consist-\nently mild-mannered disposition. See, e.g., 7 Tr. 26 (May\n19, 2004); 8 Tr. 17\u201318 (May 21, 2004). Whatever the reason,\nthe defense chose not to turn Sneed\u2019s mental health into an\nimpeachment issue. That left no work for Sneed\u2019s chal-\nlenged testimony to do, so it could not reasonably have af-\nfected the jury\u2019s verdict. See Napue, 360 U. S., at 269.\n   The majority concludes otherwise only by redefining the\nNapue materiality inquiry. In its view, Sneed\u2019s testimony\nis material because the jury\u2019s verdict could have changed\n\u201c[h]ad the prosecution corrected\u201d the testimony. Ante, at\n19. Thus, even \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d testimony that had no\nimpact on the jury can be material, so long as the act of cor-\nrecting it might have caused the jury to doubt the witness\u2019s\ncredibility. Ibid. We have never defined materiality in\nthese terms. Rather, we have consistently framed the issue\nas whether \u201cthe false testimony\u201d itself \u201chad an effect on the\noutcome.\u201d Napue, 360 U. S., at 272. Thus, the relevant in-\nquiry under Napue is whether the content of the false testi-\nmony at issue is material. Were the test for materiality\nwhether a counterfactual correction of a false statement\nmight tend to undermine the witness\u2019s credibility, the ma-\n\f28                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nteriality requirement would be meaningless in a great num-\nber of cases.\n   Napue itself illustrates this point. The \u201cprincipal state\nwitness\u201d in that case \u201ctestified . . . that he had received no\npromise of consideration in return for his testimony\u201d when\nthe prosecutor \u201chad in fact promised him consideration\u201d in\nthe form of support for a reduced sentence. Id., at 265\u2013266.\nThe Court did not find this false testimony material merely\nbecause such testimony generally undermines a witness\u2019s\ncredibility. Rather, the Court took issue with the content\nof the testimony: \u201cHad the jury been apprised of the true\nfacts, . . . it might well have concluded that [the witness]\nhad fabricated testimony in order to curry the favor of the\u201d\nprosecutor. Id., at 270; see also Wearry v. Cain, 577 U. S.\n385, 393\u2013394 (2016) (per curiam) (similarly finding false\ntestimony material because it concerned whether the wit-\nness was receiving favorable treatment in exchange for tes-\ntimony); Giglio, 405 U. S., at 154\u2013155 (same).\n   Rather than base its holding on Napue\u2019s actual discussion\nof materiality, see 360 U. S., at 270\u2013272, the majority seizes\non a line from a different section of the opinion: that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]\nlie is a lie, no matter what its subject.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Ante, at 19, 24\n(quoting 360 U.

But, the majority omits the\nsecond half of the sentence: \u201c \u2018and, if it is in any way relevant\nto the case, the district attorney has the responsibility and\nduty to correct what he knows to be false and elicit the\ntruth.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 270 (emphasis added). Read in its entirety,\nthe sentence makes clear that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201c \u2018duty to cor-\nrect\u2019 \u201d is triggered only if the false statement \u201c \u2018is . . . rele-\nvant to the case.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. That specification is inconsistent\nwith the majority\u2019s conception of Napue, under which any\nknown false statement triggers the duty to correct, and\nthen the question of materiality turns on a counterfactual\n\f                     Cite as: 604 U.

This\nCourt applies a defendant-friendly standard of materiality\nto Napue claims \u201cbecause they involve a corruption of the\ntruth-seeking function of the trial process.\u201d United States\nv. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 104 (1976). Where the jury does not\nrely on the false testimony because it is irrelevant, no such\ncorruption occurs.\n                              B\n  In any event, the majority fails its own test. Even fram-\ning the question as whether a correction could have affected\nthe outcome of trial, the parties have not established mate-\nriality.\n  First, irrespective of whether Sneed lied, prosecutorial\ncorrection of his testimony would not have led the jury to\ninfer that he had consciously committed perjury. The far\nmore plausible inference would have been that Sneed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The full context of Napue\u2019s materiality discussion further under-\n\nscores the decision\u2019s emphasis on the content of the false testimony ra-\nther than the effect of a counterfactual correction:\n   \u201cHad the jury been apprised of the true facts, however, it might well\nhave concluded that Hamer [the witness] had fabricated testimony in\norder to curry the favor of the very representative of the State who was\nprosecuting the case in which Hamer was testifying, for Hamer might\nhave believed that such a representative was in a position to implement\n(as he ultimately attempted to do) any promise of consideration. That\nthe Assistant State\u2019s Attorney himself thought it important to establish\nbefore the jury that no official source had promised Hamer consideration\nis made clear by his redirect examination, which was the last testimony\nof Hamer\u2019s heard by the jury:\n              .             .            .           .           .\n  \u201c[O]ur own evaluation of the record here compels us to hold that the\nfalse testimony used by the State in securing the conviction of petitioner\nmay have had an effect on the outcome of the trial.\u201d 360 U. S., at 270\u2013\n272.\n\f30                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsimply misremembered\u2014like numerous other witnesses in\nthe same trial. Recall that Glossip\u2019s second trial took place\nseven years after the events in question and six years after\nhis first trial. Many key witnesses in Glossip\u2019s second trial\ntestified in his first, leaving them open to impeachment on\nany details they remembered differently six years later.\n   The record is replete with instances of counsel\u2014including\nthe prosecutors\u2014reminding the State\u2019s witnesses of facts\nthey had forgotten or misremembered. See, e.g., 5 Tr. 90\n(May 17, 2004); 7 Tr. 83\u201385 (May 19, 2004); 8 Tr. 40\u201342\n(May 20, 2004); 9 Tr. 100 (May 21, 2004); 10 Tr. 31 (May 24,\n2004); 14 Tr. 18 (May 28, 2004). Moreover, Sneed took lith-\nium for only a brief period in 1997. Considering that this\ntestimony held no significance for any contested issue at\ntrial, in this environment there is no reason to think its cor-\nrection would have been noteworthy, much less the voil\u00e0\nmoment the majority imagines.\n   Second, correcting Sneed\u2019s allegedly false statements\nwould not have led the jury to believe that Sneed\u2019s mental\ncondition led him to attack Van Treese on his own initia-\ntive. To begin with, the prosecution had no Napue obliga-\ntion to disclose that Sneed had bipolar disorder. Napue re-\nquires prosecutors \u201cto correct\u201d what they know to be \u201cfalse\ntestimony,\u201d not to proactively identify impeachment mate-\nrial. 360 U. S., at 265. At most, the only false statement\nwas Sneed\u2019s assertion that he had not seen a psychiatrist.\nThe OCCA found Sneed \u201cwas more than likely in denial of\nhis mental health disorders.\u201d 529 P. 3d, at 227. This fac-\ntual finding has record support. Sneed asserted during his\npretrial competency evaluation that he \u201cdoes not think he\nhas any serious mental problems.\u201d 2 App. 701. That state-\nment predated his plea agreement and so cannot be chalked\nup to trying to maintain his credibility on the stand. The\nOCCA thus reasonably found Sneed\u2019s statement about his\nown knowledge was not false. Nor did Sneed testify that he\nwas given lithium to treat a cold. See ante, at 23\u201324. He\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            31\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsaid only that \u201cshortly after\u201d he had asked for Sudafed he\nwas given lithium for a \u201creason\u201d that he \u201cd[id]n\u2019t know.\u201d 12\nTr. 64 (May 26, 2004). Sneed thus never falsely testified as\nto why he received lithium. And, without knowing why a\npsychiatrist prescribed lithium to Sneed, a lay jury would\nnot likely be able to attribute much significance to the mere\nfact that a psychiatrist did so.\n   Regardless, there is no reason to think that disclosing\nSneed\u2019s bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of\nthe trial. Glossip\u2019s defense team was well aware of Sneed\u2019s\ncondition and chose not to use it as impeachment evidence.\nAs appellate judges examining a cold record 20 years after\nthe trial, we should be wary of believing that we understand\nthe import of evidence better than Glossip\u2019s counsel. More-\nover, the defense made no effort in its questions and argu-\nmentation to lay the groundwork for a theory that Sneed\nacted on a manic impulse. So, it is hard to see why the jury\nwould have developed any theory on its own from a cursory\nmention of the condition.\n   Finally, the Court cannot rescue its materiality analysis\nby invoking the cumulative-error doctrine. The Court as-\nserts with virtually no legal analysis that various other vi-\nolations of state and federal law undermine confidence in\nthe verdict. Ante, at 21\u201322. But, the cumulative-error doc-\ntrine applies only if there are multiple errors to consider cu-\nmulatively. See Wearry, 577 U. S., at 394 (only \u201cwrongfully\nwithheld\u201d evidence can be assessed cumulatively under\nBrady and Napue); Hanson v. Sherrod, 797 F. 3d 810, 852\n(CA10 2015) (\u201cWe cumulate error only upon a showing of at\nleast two actual errors\u201d). The OCCA held that the remain-\ning claims of error the Court asserts are either procedurally\nbarred, meritless, or both. See 529 P. 3d, at 227; 3 App.\n776\u2013783; No. PCD\u20132022\u2013589 (OCCA, Nov. 10, 2022), p. 11;\nsupra, at 9\u201311. We did not grant certiorari to review the\ncorrectness of those decisions, so they are not properly be-\nfore us. See Pet. for Cert. i.\n\f32                      GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   In all events, the other claimed violations are meritless\nor beyond our jurisdiction. The State\u2019s supposed violation\nof the rule of sequestration is a state-law issue over which\nwe have no jurisdiction. See 3 App. 780\u2013781. 8 The\nevidence-destruction claim is the majority\u2019s own creation.\nAlthough both parties mention alleged evidence destruction\nin the background statements of their briefs, neither argues\nto this Court that any destruction of evidence amounted to\na violation of federal law militating in favor of reversal. See\nBrief for Petitioner 33\u201338; Brief for Respondent 30\u201331. So\ntoo, there is no evidence that Sneed wished to \u201crecant\u201d his\ntestimony, ante, at 21; to the contrary, Sneed explained to\nReed Smith that \u201crecant[ing]\u201d was \u201cimpossible because I\ntold the truth,\u201d 3 App. 724 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also n. 2, supra (further explaining that Sneed has\nnever denied the truth of his testimony against Glossip).\nAnd, the claim that Glossip sold his couch and television for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority insists that the alleged violation of the rule of seques-\n\ntration is more than a state-law issue, ante, at 22, n. 9, but for support it\noffers only a case discussing \u201cthe ethical limits on guiding witnesses\u201d as\ndefined by the American Bar Association\u2019s model professional responsi-\nbility code for States, see Geders v. United States, 425 U. S. 80, 90, and\nn. 3 (1976). Moreover, although the State has confessed a violation of\n\u201cthe rule of sequestration\u201d (without addressing the OCCA\u2019s earlier, con-\ntrary decision, see supra, at 10\u201311), it has not conceded that Smothermon\nimproperly influenced Sneed\u2019s testimony, see Brief for Respondent 13; 3\nApp. 978. Such a claim is utterly unsupported. Glossip initially based\nthis accusation on \u201chandwritten notes\u201d found in a copy of Smothermon\u2019s\nletter to Sneed\u2019s attorney, which Glossip claimed were instructions from\nSmothermon on what Sneed was to say at trial. See Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 22\u20136500, p. 20. But, Glossip now concedes that those notes came\nfrom Sneed\u2019s attorney, not Smothermon. Brief for Petitioner 13, n. 4.\nDespite this concession, the majority asserts that Smothermon acted im-\nproperly when she stated at trial that, although she had spoken with\nSneed\u2019s attorney, she had never before heard him claim that he had at-\ntempted to stab Van Treese in the chest. Ante, at 22, n. 9 (citing 12 Tr.\n107\u2013108 (May 26, 2004)). The majority offers no evidence to suggest that\nthis statement was false. Yet, it insists on deeming Smothermon\u2019s con-\nduct a serious ethical breach.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)           33\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n$900 on January 8\u2014thus suggesting an alternative source\nfor the money he stole from Van Treese\u2014is a nonstarter:\nGlossip himself testified under oath that he received only\n$490 for those items and others. 15 Tr. 17 (June 1, 2004).\n  In short, even setting aside our lack of jurisdiction, Glos-\nsip still lacks a valid Napue claim because Sneed\u2019s allegedly\nfalse testimony was immaterial.\n                              IV\n   Having erred in both its threshold and merits analyses,\nthe majority rounds out its opinion with an indefensible re-\nmedial decree. Rather than vacate the decision below, the\nmajority takes the remarkable step of requiring a new trial.\nAnte, at 27\u201329. But, whether Glossip is entitled to a new\ntrial turns on several unresolved questions of state law that\nthis Court has no authority to disregard or decide for itself.\nAnd, at the very least, Glossip cannot show that he is enti-\ntled to relief without an evidentiary hearing.\n                             A\n  Even if the majority is correct that this Court has juris-\ndiction and that the OCCA misapplied Napue, the appro-\npriate remedy is to remand for further proceedings. This\nCourt has no authority to order a new trial.\n                              1\n   This Court cannot order a new trial unless federal law\nrequired the OCCA to do so in the decision below. \u201cIt is\nbeyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power\nover the courts of the several States.\u201d Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000). \u201cOur only power over\nstate judgments is to correct them to the extent that they\nincorrectly adjudge federal rights.\u201d Herb, 324 U. S., at 125\u2013\n126. Even when a federal question gives this Court juris-\ndiction to review a state-court judgment, \u201cState courts\u201d re-\nmain \u201cthe only proper tribunal\u201d for \u201cthe decision of ques-\ntions\u201d in the case \u201carising under their local law.\u201d Murdock\n\f34                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nv. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 626 (1875). Thus, when a state\ncourt\u2019s judgment rests on an erroneous interpretation of\nfederal law, this Court must \u201ceither render such judgment\nhere as the State court should have rendered, or remand\nthe case to that court, as the circumstances of the case may\nrequire.\u201d Id., at 636. It has no authority to order relief that\nthe state court could legitimately have refused. And, natu-\nrally, we cannot determine what judgment \u201cthe State court\nshould have rendered\u201d if doing so requires resolving ques-\ntions of state law beyond our jurisdiction. Id., at 626, 636.\nIn such cases, remand is the only legitimate disposition.\nId., at 636.\n   Our customary practice reflects these principles. \u201cNor-\nmally the Supreme Court, when reversing a state court\njudgment, remands the case for proceedings \u2018not incon-\nsistent\u2019 with the Court\u2019s opinion. The state court is there-\nfore free to resolve any undecided questions or even to alter\nits determination of underlying state law.\u201d W. Baude, J.\nGoldsmith, J. Manning, J. Pfander, & A.

Himmelfarb, Supreme\nCourt Practice \u00a73.27, p. 3\u201394 (11th ed. 2019). The Court\nusually refrains from directing a specific form of relief even\nwhen reversing decisions made on direct appeal of a crimi-\nnal conviction, with no apparent issues of state law remain-\ning to be decided. See, e.g., Counterman v. Colorado, 600\nU. S. 66, 82\u201383 (2023); Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, 597\nU. S. 629, 656 (2022); Hemphill v. New York, 595 U.

And,\nmore importantly, the majority\u2019s directive exceeds the lim-\nits on this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. For at least three reasons,\nstate-law questions prevent this Court from holding that\nthe OCCA should have granted Glossip a new trial below.\n   First, the majority\u2019s jurisdictional holding necessarily\nleaves open state-law questions for the OCCA to address on\nremand. The Court finds jurisdiction by invoking the Long\npresumption that a state court \u201creli[es] on federal law\u201d\nwhen it is \u201cinsufficiently \u2018clear from the face of the opinion\u2019 \u201d\nthat its decision rests on state law. Ante, at 15 (quoting 463\nU. S., at 1040\u20131041). But, the Long presumption is just\nthat\u2014a presumption. When this Court invokes it, state\ncourts \u201cremai[n] free\u201d to \u201c \u2018reinstat[e] their prior judgments\nafter clarifying their reliance on state grounds.\u2019 \u201d Arizona\nv. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 8, and n. 3 (1995); see also Kansas v.\nCarr, 577 U. S. 108, 128 (2016) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)\n(recognizing that, when this Court relies on the Long pre-\nsumption, the \u201clower court is able to reinstate its holding as\na matter of state law\u201d). \u201cEven when the Supreme Court\ndoes review an ambiguous decision and reverses on the fed-\neral issue, the state courts retain the power on remand to\nconsider independent state-law grounds and, indeed, to rely\non such grounds in reinstating their initial judgment.\u201d\nHart & Wechsler 672. The OCCA is therefore entitled to\nclarify that it meant to invoke \u00a71089(D)\u2019s bar on subsequent\napplications even accepting the majority\u2019s Napue analysis.\nThe majority\u2019s contrary directive ignores settled law.\n   This error is no mere technical violation. It erases an es-\nsential component of the Long presumption, which is meant\nto \u201cpreserve the integrity of federal law\u201d and to \u201cprovide\nstate judges with a clearer opportunity to develop state ju-\nrisprudence unimpeded by federal interference.\u201d 463 U. S.,\nat 1041. Presuming a federal basis for ambiguous decisions\n\f36                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nensures that States cannot evade federal review by obfus-\ncation. At the same time, allowing for clarification on re-\nmand preserves state courts\u2019 freedom to develop and apply\ntheir own law as they see fit. We have even said that re-\nversing under the Long presumption makes state courts\n\u201cfreer\u201d to develop their own law because they can do so\nwhile \u201cdisabused of [an] erroneous view of what the United\nStates Constitution requires.\u201d Evans, 514 U. S., at 8. In\ncontrast, under the majority\u2019s approach, ambiguity in the\ndecision below gives this Court license to vaporize any in-\ndependent state grounds that it does not like, no matter\nhow clearly they ought to apply as a matter of state law.\nThis sort of federal power grab dishonors our dual system\nof state and federal courts.\n   Second, even setting aside \u00a71089(D)(8), there are several\npotential independent state-law grounds for denying relief\nthat the OCCA has not yet considered. Where there is \u201ca\npossible adequate and independent state ground\u201d for the de-\ncision below that \u201cwas not addressed by the state court,\u201d\n\u201cthe state court may address th[e] question on remand.\u201d\nCalifornia v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 997\u2013998, n. 7 (1983).\nIndeed, the \u201csettled rule\u201d is that \u201cthe Supreme Court will\nremand to permit the state court to resolve the undeter-\nmined state law issue.\u201d Hart & Wechsler 655. \u201cThe state\ncourt remains free to reinstate its prior judgment on that\nstate-law ground.\u201d Ibid. (collecting cases of reinstatement);\nsee also Smith v. Texas, 550 U. S. 297, 325 (2007) (ALITO,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[I]n cases in which this Court has reversed\na state-court decision based on a possible federal constitu-\ntional violation, it is not uncommon for the state court on\nremand to reinstate the same judgment on state-law\ngrounds\u201d (collecting cases)).       Here, several potential\ngrounds for reinstating the decision below are apparent.\n   To begin, the alleged Napue violation may be harmless\nunder the PCPA\u2019s prejudice standard. See \u00a71089(C)(2). Be-\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025)            37\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlow, the OCCA recognized that this standard required Glos-\nsip to prove that preventing the errors he alleged \u201cwould\nhave changed the outcome\u201d of the trial. 529 P. 3d, at 224;\nsee \u00a71089(C)(2). In its confession of error, the State also\nagreed that \u201cGlossip needs to show . . . that the outcome of\nthe trial would have been different.\u201d 3 App. 976 (citing\n\u00a71089(C)). The OCCA had no occasion to consider this\nstandard, however, because it concluded that any false tes-\ntimony would have been immaterial under the federal no-\nreasonable-probability standard. See 529 P. 3d, at 227.\nThe Court today applies that standard and disagrees. Ante,\nat 19\u201322. But, no court has yet applied \u00a71089(C)(2)\u2019s\nhigher\u2014and concededly applicable\u2014standard. The OCCA\nshould have the chance to do so on remand.\n   In addition, in the proceedings below, only the State ar-\ngued that there was a Napue violation, and it is unclear\nwhether the State can raise a claim on a defendant\u2019s behalf.\nSee \u00a71089(A) (assuming that an \u201capplication for post-\nconviction relief \u201d comes from \u201ca defendant\u201d). Nor is it clear\nthat the State timely raised its Napue objection. State law\nrequired Glossip to file his application within 60 days of the\nState\u2019s disclosure of Box 8. See OCCA Rule 9.7(G)(3). Glos-\nsip met that deadline. The State did not. See 3 App. 973\n(response dated 69 days after disclosure of Box 8). Thus,\nany Napue claim is at least arguably untimely. And, there\nmay be more state-law issues for the OCCA to consider of\nwhich we are unaware simply because we are unfamiliar\nwith Oklahoma\u2019s highly specialized post-conviction proce-\ndure.\n   Third, even if state law does not bar Glossip\u2019s Napue\nclaim entirely, state law appears not to authorize a new\ntrial as the remedy for a violation at this stage. Cf. Price v.\nGeorgia, 398 U. S. 323, 332 (1970) (remanding after finding\npetitioner\u2019s conviction unconstitutional because petitioner\u2019s\nprecise remedy turned \u201cupon the construction of several\n\f38                 GLOSSIP v.

The PCPA au-\nthorizes only two dispositions of a capital post-conviction\napplication when it is first filed with the OCCA: denial, or\nremand to the trial court for a merits determination.\n\u00a7\u00a71089(D)(4) and (5). The OCCA has made clear that the\nAct does not authorize vacating the applicant\u2019s conviction\nor sentence at that initial stage, for \u201caffidavits and eviden-\ntiary materials filed in support of a post-conviction applica-\ntion are not part of the trial record but are only part of the\ncapital post-conviction record.\u201d Slaughter v. State, 2005 OK\nCR 2, \u00b611, 105 P. 3d 832, 835. \u201cAs such, those affidavits\nand evidentiary materials are not reviewed on their merits\nbut are reviewed . . . \u2018[t]o determine if a threshold showing\nis met to require a review on the merits.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting\nOCCA Rule 9.7(D)(1)(a); emphasis added).\n   In this respect, the OCCA\u2019s initial review of capital post-\nconviction proceedings is analogous to AEDPA\u2019s procedure\nfor second and successive federal habeas petitions. Before\nan applicant can proceed with such a petition, he must first\nfile a motion for authorization in the court of appeals. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(b)(3)(A). If the applicant makes a prima fa-\ncie showing that he satisfies the special requirements for\nsecond and successive petitions, the court of appeals au-\nthorizes proceedings in the district court. \u00a72244(b)(3)(C).\nBut, if the applicant fails to make a prima facie showing,\nthe court of appeals denies authorization, and the proceed-\nings end. No matter how strong the applicant\u2019s ultimate\nclaim, the court of appeals cannot grant habeas relief at\nthat stage; only a district court may do so. For the same\nreason, it makes no sense to say that no \u201cfurther eviden-\ntiary proceedings\u201d are warranted because the OCCA\n\u201cagree[d]\u201d they are unnecessary. Ante, at 26. The OCCA\u2019s\nauthority to deny relief without a hearing does not imply\ncorresponding authority to summarily grant relief.\n   In short, multiple state-law issues foreclose this Court\n\f                 Cite as: 604 U.

Murdock, 20 Wall., at 636.\nThe Court therefore has no authority to order one itself.\n                               3\n   The majority insists that \u201cGlossip is entitled to a new\ntrial\u201d simply because \u201cthis Court has jurisdiction\u201d and \u201c[a]\nnew trial is the remedy for a Napue violation.\u201d Ante, at 29.\nThis response overlooks, however, that \u201cStates may apply\ntheir own neutral procedural rules to federal claims.\u201d How-\nlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372 (1990). Here, Glossip seeks\npost-conviction relief under Oklahoma\u2019s PCPA.             See\n\u00a71080(1); supra, at 16\u201318. Under that Act, a new trial is\nnot the remedy for a Napue violation unless Glossip also\nsatisfies certain procedural requirements and unless his\ncase first proceeds to a merits hearing before a state trial\ncourt. See \u00a71089(D)(4); Slaughter, 105 P. 3d, at 835.\n   For similar reasons, the majority\u2019s reliance on Ake v. Ok-\nlahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), in which this Court reversed\nthe OCCA and remanded for a new trial, id., at 73\u201374, 87,\nis misplaced. See ante, at 29. The asserted state ground in\nthat case was a \u201cwaiver rule\u201d with an established exception\nfor \u201cfederal constitutional errors.\u201d 470 U. S., at 74\u201375. In\nother words, the waiver rule turned on \u201cwhether federal\nconstitutional error ha[d] been committed.\u201d Id., at 75.\nThus, it was perfectly clear that the rule there could not\nsupply an independent ground for denying a federal consti-\ntutional claim. And, because the case arose on direct re-\nview, id., at 73\u201374, the Court could also have confidence\nthat no other state ground could support the decision below,\nand therefore that the petitioner was legally entitled to a\nnew trial. Here, by contrast, the Court has found jurisdic-\ntion only by applying the Long presumption; the case arises\nfrom a subsequent post-conviction application in a complex\nstate-law regime that imposes numerous procedural bars;\nthere are several state grounds that could foreclose relief\n\f40                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nentirely; and the OCCA issued the decision below in a pre-\nliminary posture in which it was not authorized to order a\nnew trial. Further, although the new-trial order in Ake was\nlegally defensible, it was still a significant departure from\nordinary practice, which is to remand for further proceed-\nings even on direct review. See supra, at 34.\n   The majority further insists that no \u201cprecedent\u201d requires\na remand based on the Long presumption. Ante, at 28. It\nclaims that at most this Court has recognized the power of\nstate courts to \u201c \u2018grant relief to criminal defendants\u2019 \u201d under\nstate law after erroneously granting relief under federal\nlaw. Ibid. That assertion is incorrect. Evans recognized\nstate courts\u2019 power to reinstate their judgments after rever-\nsal as part of a general discussion of the Long presumption.\nSee 514 U. S., at 7\u20139. Its reasoning was not confined to the\nspecific context of a state court granting relief to a criminal\ndefendant. Similarly, treatise writers have recognized that\nstate courts can reinstate their judgments whenever this\nCourt \u201creview[s] an ambiguous decision.\u201d Hart & Wechsler\n672. And, more fundamentally, when this Court asserts ju-\nrisdiction based on the Long presumption, \u201cwe merely as-\nsume that there are no [adequate and independent state]\ngrounds\u201d justifying the decision below; we do not conclu-\nsively decide that none exists. 463 U. S., at 1042 (emphasis\nadded). Without a definitive ruling that no independent\nstate ground bars ordering a new trial, we cannot hold that\nordering a new trial is the \u201cjudgment\u201d that \u201cthe State court\nshould have rendered.\u201d Murdock, 20 Wall., at 636. The ma-\njority cannot have it both ways. If it wants to rely on the\nLong presumption to find jurisdiction, it must accept the\nlimitations that the presumption entails.\n                              4\n   Finally, the majority asserts that Glossip is presently en-\ntitled to a new trial, because, under Oklahoma law, a con-\ncession that an error occurred at trial renders irrelevant all\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

As I\nhave already explained, the precedents cited by the Court\ndo not support that proposition; they establish only that\ncourts have an independent duty to assess confessed errors\nfor themselves, which is nearly the opposite of the major-\nity\u2019s point. Supra, at 23\u201324. To make matters even more\nimplausible, the Court apparently interprets this principle\nto mean that a confession of error transforms a nonmerits\npreliminary proceeding into a merits proceeding where the\nOCCA can directly order ultimate relief. And, more im-\nportantly, it is for the OCCA to decide whether state law\nentitles Glossip to a new trial at this time, and it is absurd\nto think that the only conclusion the OCCA could reach is\nthe majority\u2019s.\n                              B\n   Even if we could blind ourselves to the foregoing proce-\ndural issues, Glossip would still be entitled to no more than\nan evidentiary hearing on his Napue claim. The Court says\nthat the facts \u201csupported by the record establish a violation\nof Napue,\u201d as though it were a trial court making findings\nafter an evidentiary hearing. Ante, at 29. That approach\ncannot possibly be right. The PCPA envisions that further\nproceedings are necessary if there are \u201ccontroverted, previ-\nously unresolved factual issues.\u201d \u00a71089(D)(5). On this rec-\nord, I do not see how one could conclude that there is not\neven a genuine issue of fact as to whether a Napue claim\nhas been established\u2014especially considering that Glossip\nhimself recognized below that, without further discovery,\nhis claims rested on \u201cspeculation.\u201d Motion for Evidentiary\nHearing, at 1\u20132.\n   Concluding that no new factual development is needed is\nparticularly inappropriate given the alternative reading of\nthe notes advanced by the Van Treese family in this Court.\nAs discussed above, the family has argued that the sup-\nposed \u201csmoking gun\u201d\u2014the notes from Box 8\u2014in fact reflects\n\f42                  GLOSSIP v.

Smother-\nmon and Ackley have likewise endorsed this interpretation,\nwhich casts serious doubt on Glossip\u2019s and the State\u2019s the-\nory. Ibid. If Sneed simply reported that he was asked about\nDr. Trombka without admitting Dr. Trombka prescribed\nhim lithium, Smothermon and Ackley would have had no\nreason to know that Dr. Trombka prescribed him lithium.\nAnd, the indication in Ackley\u2019s notes that Sneed apparently\nmentioned his \u201c \u2018tooth\u2019 \u201d being \u201c \u2018pulled\u2019 \u201d suggests that Sneed\nstood by his earlier story that he was mistakenly prescribed\nlithium when his tooth was pulled. 3 App. 940; see 2 id., at\n700 (Sneed\u2019s earlier statement).\n   Given the existence of a plausible alternative interpreta-\ntion of the evidence, I would not order a new trial at this\ntime even if we had discretion to do so. To the extent the\nCourt insists it cannot endorse the family\u2019s theory because\nit relies on \u201cextra-record materials not properly before the\nCourt,\u201d ante, at 25, such as parts of Ackley\u2019s notes, that is\nbecause the parties collusively excluded this highly rele-\nvant evidence from the record in order to reach a predeter-\nmined outcome. The majority rewards this gamesmanship,\nand in so doing denies the victim\u2019s family the opportunity\nto present contrary evidence.\n   The \u201cGovernment should turn square corners in dealing\nwith the people.\u201d St. Regis Paper Co. v.

II, \u00a734(A). Glossip, on the\nother hand, would suffer no prejudice from an evidentiary\nhearing in which the Van Treese family had the opportunity\nto present its case. If the evidence is as decisive as the ma-\njority believes, Glossip would still receive a new trial. There\nis no excuse for denying the Van Treese family its day in\ncourt.\n   After having bent the law at every turn to grant relief to\nGlossip, the Court suddenly retreats to faux formalism\nwhen dealing with the victim\u2019s family. The Court concludes\nthat it need not honor the family\u2019s right to be heard because\nthe family did not request an evidentiary hearing earlier in\nthe proceedings. Ante, at 27, n. 11. But, the family had no\nneed to do so, since Glossip had conceded that \u201ca hearing is\nnecessary\u201d for his claim to rise above the level of \u201cspecula-\ntion.\u201d Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, at 2. And, before\nthis Court, the Van Treese family has vigorously asserted\nits interests. The family filed the only brief opposing certi-\norari in this case. See Brief for Victim Family Members\net al. as Amici Curiae in Opposition. It filed a merits brief\nhighlighting critical evidence that the parties sought to\nsweep under the rug. See supra, at 12\u201313, and n. 3. And,\nit filed a motion to participate in oral argument, which this\nCourt denied. 603 U. S. ___ (2024). The majority\u2019s asser-\ntion that the family has sat on its rights is groundless. Nor\nis there any reason to believe that Oklahoma victims\u2019 right\nto be heard in \u201cany proceeding,\u201d Art. II, \u00a734(A), contains an\nimplicit exception for \u201cpost-conviction hearings,\u201d ante, at\n27, n. 11. Finally, even if the family had no formal right to\nbe heard, any reasonable factfinder plainly could consider\nthe account of the evidence that the family has brought to\nlight, making the majority\u2019s procedural objections beside\nthe point. Make no mistake: The majority is choosing to\ncast aside the family\u2019s interests. I would not.\n\f44                 GLOSSIP v.

Argued October 9, 2024\u2014Decided February 25, 2025\nIn 1997, Justin Sneed beat Barry Van Treese to death with a baseball\n  bat at an Oklahoma hotel owned by Van Treese and managed by peti-\n  tioner Richard Glossip. Glossip initially made inconsistent statements\n  to the police about Sneed\u2019s role in the murder, but he ultimately told\n  police that Sneed admitted to killing Van Treese. Sneed later claimed\n  Glossip had asked him to murder Van Treese because, among other\n  things, Glossip had wanted to steal Van Treese\u2019s money. Glossip main-\n  tained his innocence and refused a plea deal that would have had him\n  avoid the death penalty in return for testifying against Sneed. Sneed\n  then testified against Glossip at trial in exchange for avoiding the\n  death penalty, and Sneed\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence con-\n  necting Glossip to the murder. The jury convicted Glossip and sen-\n  tenced him to death. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n  (OCCA) overturned that conviction because the defense had been inef-\n  fective in challenging Sneed\u2019s testimony and the remainder of the evi-\n  dence only weakly corroborated Sneed\u2019s account. At the retrial, Sneed\n  provided inconsistent testimony on potential motives for Glossip\u2019s\n  murder. Sneed also denied that he had been prescribed lithium or seen\n  a psychiatrist. After the defense established (through the State\u2019s med-\n  ical examiner) that Van Treese had been attacked with a knife as well\n  as a bat, Sneed testified that he had repeatedly tried to stab Van\n  Treese in the chest with a pocket knife. But Sneed had previously de-\n  nied stabbing Van Treese both when questioned by the police as well\n  as at Glossip\u2019s first trial. Glossip moved for a mistrial based on the\n  prosecution\u2019s failure to notify the defense about Sneed\u2019s change in tes-\n  timony, which the trial court denied after the prosecution disclaimed\n  any knowledge about the change. Glossip was again convicted and\n  sentenced to death, and a closely divided OCCA affirmed, holding that\n\f2                         GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    circumstantial evidence suggesting Glossip had mismanaged the hotel,\n    combined with Glossip\u2019s concession that he had been dishonest in his\n    initial statements after the murder, sufficiently corroborated Sneed\u2019s\n    testimony that he killed Van Treese at Glossip\u2019s direction.\n       Glossip subsequently filed several unsuccessful habeas petitions.\n    Concerns over the integrity of his conviction led a bipartisan group of\n    Oklahoma legislators to commission an independent investigation by\n    a law firm, Reed Smith. In June 2022, Reed Smith reported \u201cgrave\n    doubt\u201d about Glossip\u2019s conviction, citing factors such as the prosecu-\n    tion\u2019s deliberate destruction of key evidence and the false portrayal of\n    Justin Sneed as a non-violent \u201cpuppet.\u201d The State then disclosed seven\n    boxes of previously withheld documents, including letters suggesting\n    Sneed had considered recanting and a note from prosecutor Connie\n    Smothermon to Sneed\u2019s lawyer noting they should \u201cget to\u201d Sneed to\n    discuss his problematic testimony about a knife found in Van Treese\u2019s\n    room. Glossip filed for post-conviction relief based on this evidence and\n    evidence revealed by Reed Smith. Glossip also argued that, during his\n    second trial, Smothermon had interfered with Sneed\u2019s testimony about\n    the knife in violation of the rule of sequestration, which prohibits wit-\n    nesses from hearing each other\u2019s testimony. Oklahoma waived any\n    procedural defenses to Glossip\u2019s claims, and asked the OCCA to deny\n    the claims on their merits. The OCCA denied Glossip\u2019s claims as pro-\n    cedurally barred and meritless.\n       The State then discovered additional documents revealing that\n    Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lith-\n    ium, contradicting his trial testimony.

Glossip filed a successive petition for post-conviction\n    relief, which the attorney general supported, conceding multiple errors\n    that warranted a new trial. The OCCA denied the unopposed petition\n    without a hearing, holding that Glossip\u2019s claims were procedurally\n    barred under Oklahoma\u2019s Post-Conviction Procedures Act (PCPA), and\n    further that the State\u2019s concession was not \u201cbased in law or fact\u201d be-\n    cause it did not create a Napue error.

Here, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general joins Glossip in asserting a\nNapue error, conceding that Sneed\u2019s testimony about his lithium pre-\nscription was false and that the prosecution knowingly failed to correct\nit. The record supports that confession of error. Evidence showed that\nSneed was prescribed lithium to treat bipolar disorder, not after ask-\ning for cold medicine as he claimed at trial. The evidence likewise es-\ntablishes that the prosecution knew Sneed\u2019s testimony was false. The\nprosecution almost certainly had access to Sneed\u2019s medical file through\nSneed\u2019s competency evaluation. And Smothermon\u2019s notes show that\nshe had a pre-trial conversation with Sneed at which he mentioned\n\u201clithium\u201d and \u201cDr. Trumpet.\u201d The straightforward inference is that\nSmothermon was aware before trial that Sneed had received his lith-\nium prescription from Dr. Trombka, a psychiatrist and the sole medi-\ncal professional at the Oklahoma County jail authorized to prescribe\nlithium.\n   Because Sneed\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence of Glossip\u2019s\nguilt, the jury\u2019s assessment of Sneed\u2019s credibility was material and\nnecessarily determinative. Correcting Sneed\u2019s lie would have under-\nmined his credibility and revealed his willingness to lie under oath.\nThe false testimony also bore on Glossip\u2019s guilt because evidence of\n\f4                        GLOSSIP v.

Hence\n    there is a reasonable likelihood that correcting Sneed\u2019s testimony\n    would have affected the judgment of the jury.

Consequently, the pros-\n    ecution\u2019s failure to correct Sneed\u2019s false testimony entitles Glossip to a\n    new trial under Napue.\n          (b) The OCCA\u2019s contrary holding rests on a mistaken interpreta-\n    tion of Napue. The OCCA held that there was no violation because the\n    defense was aware or should have been aware that Sneed was taking\n    lithium. But Sneed\u2019s false testimony concerned the reasons for his pre-\n    scription, not merely the fact that he had taken lithium. Moreover, the\n    Due Process Clause imposes the duty to correct false testimony on the\n    State, not the defense. The OCCA\u2019s holding that Sneed was likely in\n    denial of his mental health disorders is beside the point; what matters\n    is that the testimony was false and the prosecutor knowingly allowed\n    it to stand.\n       Additional arguments in support of the OCCA\u2019s position are unper-\n    suasive. Napue does not require that the false testimony itself must\n    have directly affected the trial\u2019s outcome; Napue requires assessing\n    whether the prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct the testimony could have\n    contributed to the verdict. Also unpersuasive are arguments based on\n    extra-record materials and insufficient time spent interviewing the\n    prosecutor.\n       Because the attorney general\u2019s confession of error is supported by\n    ample evidence, the Court declines to remand this case for further ev-\n    identiary proceedings. When the Court has jurisdiction, a new trial is\n    the appropriate remedy for a violation of Napue.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9841318\"><a href=\"/opinion/9427692/glossip-v-state/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: GLOSSIP v.

At trial, Sneed admitted he beat\nVan Treese to death, but testified that Glossip had offered\nhim thousands of dollars to do so. Glossip confessed he\nhelped Sneed conceal his crime after the fact, but he denied\nany involvement in the murder.\n  Nearly two decades later, the State disclosed eight boxes\nof previously withheld documents from Glossip\u2019s trial.\nThese documents show that Sneed suffered from bipolar\ndisorder, which, combined with his known drug use, could\nhave caused impulsive outbursts of violence. They also es-\ntablished, the State agrees, that a jail psychiatrist pre-\nscribed Sneed lithium to treat that condition, and that the\nprosecution allowed Sneed falsely to testify at trial that he\nhad never seen a psychiatrist. Faced with that evidence,\nOklahoma\u2019s attorney general confessed error.

Finally, Sneed testified\nabout Glossip\u2019s purported motives for killing Van Treese.\nHe asserted that Glossip had suggested \u201crobbing Barry of\nhis money,\u201d id., at 75, that he had \u201ctold [Sneed] at one point\nthat with Mr. Van Treese out of the way . . . he would be\nable not only [to] manage the motel on Council but also an-\nother one they had [in Tulsa],\u201d id., at 89, and that he had\nworried he \u201cwas going to get fired\u201d because \u201ca couple of the\nrooms that were already supposed to be remodeled . . .\nweren\u2019t,\u201d id., at 95.\n   The prosecution weaved these suggestions into its closing\nargument along with its original theory that Glossip had\nwanted Van Treese dead to avoid being fired for embezzle-\nment.

Although that litigation did not result in\nrelief, mounting concerns over the integrity of Glossip\u2019s con-\nviction drew the attention of the Oklahoma Legislature.

The record supports that confession of error.\nA summary of Sneed\u2019s medical records created by the local\nsheriff \u2019s department establishes that someone diagnosed\nSneed with bipolar disorder and prescribed him lithium. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3\nApp. 1005</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Id., at 930\u2013931. Dr. Trombka also confirmed,\nand nobody contests, that lithium is used only in psychiat-\nric treatments and not for dental pain (as Sneed said at a\npretrial hearing) or a cold (as Sneed testified at Glossip\u2019s\ntrial). Ibid. Nor would anyone confuse lithium with Su-\ndafed, which is a cold medication. Ibid. Sneed\u2019s trial testi-\nmony that he had been given lithium after asking for Su-\ndafed and had \u201cnever seen no psychiatrist or anything\u201d was\ntherefore false.\n   The evidence likewise establishes that the prosecution\n\f18                  GLOSSIP v.

Among other things,\nthose records would have been provided to the State as part\nof Sneed\u2019s competency evaluation, id., at 931, and the State\nopposed Glossip\u2019s discovery request of Sneed\u2019s medical files\non its merits, 2 id., at 622\u2013623; 3 id., at 933.

Glossip argues, and\nthe attorney general admits, that this shows Sneed told\nSmothermon that Dr. Trumpet (meaning Dr. Trombka) had\nprescribed him lithium. As just discussed, the record shows\nthat, in fact, Dr. Trombka did diagnose Sneed with bipolar\ndisorder and prescribe him lithium. Sneed plainly dis-\ncussed these matters with the prosecution.

As Smothermon\u2019s co-counsel Gary Ackley\nhas conceded, it \u201cwould have been an important fact for the\ndefense to know\u201d that Sneed had been prescribed lithium to\ntreat bipolar disorder. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 App. 940</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Sneed\nadmitted at trial that he regularly used drugs, including\nmethamphetamine.

See supra, at 18\u201322. 10\n   The remaining arguments offered in defense of the\nOCCA\u2019s position are likewise unpersuasive. In an amicus\nbrief, the Van Treese family argues that it was Glossip\u2019s\ncounsel who asked Sneed about his lithium prescription,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent also argues Sneed\u2019s lithium use was immaterial because\n\n\u201cthe defense chose not to turn\u201d it \u201cinto an impeachment issue,\u201d post, at\n27, but each premise in that argument is mistaken. First, the defense\ndid not choose \u201cnot to raise Sneed\u2019s mental condition,\u201d ibid.; they asked\nhim about it in cross-examination and Sneed repeated his false testi-\nmony. See 13 Tr. 15 (May 27, 2004). Second, the defense did not know\nduring trial that Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder; to the\ncontrary, Glossip later sought (and the State successfully opposed) dis-\ncovery on that issue. 2 App. 621\u2013622. Third, even if the defense had\nmade a conscious choice not to raise the (then-uncertain) reasons for\nSneed\u2019s lithium use, that would be irrelevant to the prosecution\u2019s duty to\ncorrect false testimony \u201cwhen it appears.\u201d Napue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105912\"><a href=\"/opinion/105912/napue-v-illinois/#269\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Napue v.

See Brief for Victim\nFamily Members as Amici Curiae 7\u201322. That argument re-\nlies heavily on extra-record materials not properly before\nthe Court, including a recent unsworn statement from\nSmothermon adopting the family\u2019s interpretation of the\nnotes. (The dissent, which criticizes the independent coun-\nsel for \u201cimpugning\u201d the trial prosecutors\u2019 reputation, post,\nat 15, justifies its reliance on these materials by accusing\nthe Oklahoma attorney general of \u201ccollusively exclud[ing]\u201d\nthem from the record, see post, at 42.) Nor would accepting\nthe family\u2019s account change the Napue analysis. Whatever\nthe impetus for the conversation, the family agrees that\nSneed and Smothermon discussed Dr. Trombka and lith-\nium. The natural inference is that Sneed explained to\nSmothermon the circumstances that led to his lithium use.\nTo avoid that inference, the family in turn suggests both\nthat Sneed was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder in\nthe first place, Brief for Victim Family Members as Amici\nCuriae 17, and that Glossip\u2019s counsel \u201cknew about [Dr.\nTrombka] more than two decades ago,\u201d id., at 21. Yet for\nthe reasons previously explained, defense counsel\u2019s pur-\nported knowledge of Dr. Trombka\u2019s existence is irrelevant,\nand the prison medical record supports the attorney gen-\neral\u2019s concession that Sneed received a lithium prescription\nas treatment for his bipolar disorder.\n   The family also maintains (and the dissent agrees) that\nReed Smith and the independent counsel spent insufficient\ntime interviewing Smothermon. Neither the family nor\nSmothermon raised that objection before the OCCA, nor\ndoes anyone now explain its relevance to the Napue analy-\nsis. The argument is also unpersuasive on its own terms.\nBoth investigators spoke to Smothermon. When they did,\nSmothermon did not provide the account she now endorses:\nthat Sneed relayed to her a conversation with Glossip\u2019s\ncounsel about Dr. Trombka and lithium. Instead, during a\n\f26                  GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthird interview, Smothermon asked the independent coun-\nsel \u201cwhy he thought it was Dr Trombka and not Dr Trumpet\nthe jazz musician and I was making a personal note or\nsomething else.\u201d App. to Brief for Victim Family Members\nas Amici Curiae 31a. There is no compelling evidence that\na fourth or fifth consultation with Smothermon would have\nyielded materially different results.\n   The Court-appointed amicus, for his part, largely aban-\ndons the OCCA\u2019s reasoning and focuses instead on ambigu-\nities in Smothermon\u2019s notes. Amicus maintains that too\nmany inferential steps separate those notes from the con-\nclusion that Sneed lied on the stand and that Smothermon\nknew it. For example, amicus argues that \u201cthe parties do\nnot explain the basis for their asserted link between \u2018Dr.\nTrumpet?\u2019 and Trombka,\u201d reiterating Smothermon\u2019s earlier\nstatements that she \u201c \u2018is not convinced that Dr. Trombka\nand \u201cDr. Trumpet\u201d are the same person.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae 32. As already explained, how-\never, there is ample evidence in the record before this Court\nsupporting the inference that Smothermon knew about\nSneed\u2019s psychiatric treatment and lithium prescription, in-\ncluding the prison medical record, Dr. Trombka\u2019s attesta-\ntions, and Smothermon\u2019s own notes.\n   Because ample evidence supports the attorney general\u2019s\nconfession of error in this Court, there also is no need to\nremand for further evidentiary proceedings at the OCCA.\nIndeed, that such proceedings are not necessary is the one\npoint on which Glossip, Oklahoma, amicus, and the OCCA\nunanimously agree. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 108 (amicus con-\nceding that \u201cI guess we all agree that [an evidentiary hear-\ning is] not . . . that it\u2019s not necessary\u201d). The partial concur-\nrence suggests this Court should nonetheless remand for\nfurther proceedings on the ground that the evidence does\nnot remove all doubt that the attorney general\u2019s view of the\nrecord is correct.

But the\nopinion can be read to say that the OCCA refused to accept\nthe attorney general\u2019s waiver of this procedural bar because\nhis confession of error was not \u201cbased in law.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation multiple-matches\"><a href=\"/c/OK%20CR/2023/5/\">2023 OK CR\n5</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b625, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9841318\"><a href=\"/opinion/9427692/glossip-v-state/#226\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: GLOSSIP v.

After all, if the trial contained fed-\neral constitutional error, then the attorney general\u2019s confes-\nsion of error may have been \u201cbased in law.\u201d Because the\nopinion lacks a \u201cplain statement\u201d clarifying that the\nOCCA\u2019s reliance on state law was truly independent of its\nassessment of Glossip\u2019s federal claims, the Court rightly\nproceeds to the merits. Michigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9842054\"><a href=\"/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1041\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Michigan v. Long\">463 U.

The OCCA appeared to think that Justin Sneed\u2019s\ntestimony \u201cwas not clearly false\u201d because he \u201cwas more\nthan likely in denial of his mental health disorders.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9841318\"><a href=\"/opinion/9427692/glossip-v-state/#227\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: GLOSSIP v.

But for purposes of Napue, the question is not\nwhether a witness subjectively thought he was lying\u2014it is\nwhether the prosecution knowingly presented untrue testi-\nmony. The OCCA also stated that Sneed\u2019s \u201cknown mental\nhealth treatment evidence\u201d would not have created a \u201crea-\nsonable probability that the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different had Sneed\u2019s testimony regarding his\nuse of lithium been further developed at trial.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9841318\"><a href=\"/opinion/9427692/glossip-v-state/#227\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: GLOSSIP v.

Yet the OCCA ignored the critical fact that\u2014had\nthe prosecutor, Connie Smothermon, corrected Sneed\u2019s tes-\ntimony\u2014the jury would have learned that Sneed made a\nfalse statement on the stand. Sneed\u2019s testimony was the\nprimary evidence that the State offered to prove that Glos-\nsip planned the murder. Faced with a prosecutor forced to\ncorrect her star witness, a juror might have disbelieved\n\f                    Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">604 U.

And if a juror went from\nbelief to disbelief in Sneed, she might have changed her ul-\ntimate assessment of whether the State had proved Glos-\nsip\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So if Sneed really did\ngive false testimony, and if Smothermon really did know-\ningly allow that testimony to go uncorrected, then Smother-\nmon violated Glossip\u2019s due process rights under Napue.\nThe OCCA\u2019s contrary statements were wrong as a matter\nof federal law.\n   I part ways with the Court on what comes next. In exer-\ncising our appellate function, it is not our role to find facts;\ninstead, we review the factual findings of lower courts, sub-\nject to a deferential standard of appellate review. See Price\nv. Johnston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9420168\"><a href=\"/opinion/104557/price-v-johnston/#291\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Price v. Johnston\">334 U. S. 266, 291</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1948). This practice makes\ngood sense. This Court is well equipped to answer ques-\ntions of federal law; it is ill equipped either to determine the\ncredibility of witnesses or to master voluminous trial rec-\nords. Other actors in our judicial system\u2014including, where\nappropriate, state courts like the OCCA\u2014better serve these\nfunctions, as our standard of review reflects. In this case,\nhowever, the Court has chosen to function as the initial\nfactfinder.\n   To establish a violation of Napue, Glossip must show that\n(1) Sneed gave false testimony and (2) Smothermon knew\nthat the testimony was false. To make these showings,\nGlossip relies largely on notes taken by Smothermon, an af-\nfidavit from Dr. Trombka, and a \u201cmedical information\nsheet.\u201d According to the Court, these documents clearly\ndemonstrate that (1) Sneed lied when he said that he did\nnot know why he had been given lithium and that he had\nnever seen a psychiatrist and (2) Smothermon knew that\nboth of these statements were lies. See ante, at 17\u201319, 26.\nThus, the Court concludes, there is no need for the OCCA\nto make its own factual findings.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *The Court suggests that this shortcut is appropriate because Glossip,\n\f4                      GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                         Opinion of BARRETT, J.\n\n  I respectfully disagree. Smothermon\u2019s notes, taken dur-\ning a jailhouse interview of Sneed, consist of the words \u201con\nLithium?\u201d and \u201cDr. Trumpet?\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 App. 927</span><pre class=\"inline\">. These notes are\nhardly clear, and there are competing explanations of what\nthey mean. Glossip, the Oklahoma attorney general, and\nthe Court argue that they demonstrate Smothermon\u2019s\nknowledge that Sneed had lied about Dr. Trombka\u2019s pre-\nscribing him lithium for bipolar disorder. See ante, at 18\u2013\n19, 26. The Van Treese amicus brief and JUSTICE THOMAS\ncontend that the notes instead reflect Sneed\u2019s account of a\nconversation with Glossip\u2019s lawyers, who had asked Sneed\nwhether he had received lithium from a \u201cDr. Trumpet.\u201d See\npost, at 11\u201313, and n. 3 (dissenting opinion). There are\nother possibilities too: For instance, perhaps Smothermon\nwas confused by references to \u201cDr. Trumpet\u201d and lithium\nbut never investigated the issue further. Neither Dr.\nTrombka\u2019s affidavit nor the attached medical information\nsheet nor any of the other record evidence discussed by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe attorney general, the Court-appointed amicus, and the OCCA \u201cunan-\nimously agree\u201d that the record is sufficiently developed. Ante, at 26. I\ndo not think that this assertion fairly captures the views of either the\namicus or the OCCA. When asked whether he \u201cobject[ed] to an eviden-\ntiary hearing,\u201d amicus\u2014whom we appointed to defend the judgment be-\nlow in this Court\u2014expressed doubt that he \u201cha[d] standing to object to\nan evidentiary hearing.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 107\u2013108. When pushed on the\npoint, he responded that the current record supports affirmance \u201cbased\non the evidence that [Glossip has] chosen to present and particularly\ngiven that he\u2019s now told you he wants the case decided on the current\nrecord [and] without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 109 (emphasis\nadded). In other words, amicus simply stated that the current record did\nnot support Glossip\u2019s claim\u2014not that the record was in any objective\nsense already fully developed. Moreover, the question here is not only\nwhether further factual development is warranted, but also which court\nshould find facts in the first instance. Amicus certainly did not concede\nthat this Court, rather than the OCCA, should play that role on this rec-\nord. As for the OCCA, its lack of explanation of the facts cannot be di-\nvorced from its erroneous view of Napue. Nothing in its opinion indicates\nwhat it would make of this record evidence if it confronted the relevant\nquestions under Napue.\n\f                 Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">604 U.

It should have corrected the OCCA\u2019s\nmisstatements of federal law and vacated the judgment,\nleaving next steps\u2014including the decision whether to con-\nduct an evidentiary hearing\u2014to the OCCA. By doing oth-\nerwise, the Court has both displaced the OCCA as fact-\nfinder and potentially overridden state-law constraints on\nthe OCCA\u2019s remedial authority.

Although\nGlossip won the support of Oklahoma\u2019s new attorney gen-\neral, he failed to persuade either body with authority to\ngrant him relief: The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) denied Glossip\u2019s application as both procedurally\ndeficient and nonmeritorious, and Oklahoma\u2019s Pardon and\nParole Board denied clemency. Because this Court lacks\nthe power to override these denials, that should have\nmarked the end of the road for Glossip. Instead, the Court\nstretches the law at every turn to rule in his favor. At the\nthreshold, it concocts federal jurisdiction by misreading the\ndecision below. On the merits, it finds a due process viola-\ntion based on patently immaterial testimony about a wit-\nness\u2019s medical condition.

Beginning\nin 1995, Glossip began working for Van Treese as the mo-\ntel\u2019s manager. 4 Tr. 182\u2013183 (May 14, 2004). In that ca-\npacity, Glossip unofficially hired 19-year-old Justin Sneed\nto be the motel\u2019s handyman. Glossip did not pay Sneed; in-\nstead, he let him live at the motel free of charge and occa-\nsionally bought him food. Id., at 43\u201344; 5 Tr. 67\u201370 (May\n17, 2004); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2 App. 644</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In late 1996, Van Treese learned of\ndiscrepancies in Glossip\u2019s accounting suggesting that Glos-\nsip had been allowing guests to stay at the motel off the\nbooks and pocketing the money for himself. 4 Tr. 63, 68\u201371\n(May 14, 2004); 7 Tr. 35, 39\u201340, 45\u201349 (May 19, 2004); 11\nTr. 172\u2013173 (May 25, 2004). During a visit to the motel on\nJanuary 6, 1997, Van Treese confronted Glossip about this\nissue, and, having discovered unregistered guests staying\nat the motel, he threatened to report Glossip to the police\nunless Glossip produced receipts for their rooms. 8 Tr. 82\n(May 20, 2004).\n  Hours later, after Van Treese had gone to bed, Sneed en-\ntered Van Treese\u2019s motel room and repeatedly beat him\nover the head with a baseball bat. 2 App. 662\u2013664; 11 Tr.\n55 (May 25, 2004). Sneed left when he thought that he had\nkilled Van Treese, although the State\u2019s forensic pathologist\nlater determined that Van Treese had initially survived the\nattack, and died several hours later after slowly bleeding\nout.

Tr.\nof Glossip Police Interview 10 (Jan. 9, 1997). Glossip began\ndirecting a coverup. On Sneed\u2019s account, Glossip first told\nSneed to clean up glass shards from a window that Sneed\nhad broken during the attack. 12 Tr. 122 (May 26, 2004).\nGlossip also sent Sneed to retrieve about $4,000 in cash\nfrom Van Treese\u2019s car, and then to abandon the car in a\nnearby credit union parking lot. Id., at 124, 129. When\nSneed returned, the two divided the cash. Id., at 128\u2013129.\nThey then entered Van Treese\u2019s room, whereupon Glossip\ndirected Sneed to tape a shower curtain over the broken\nwindow and run the air conditioning at full blast to elimi-\nnate any odor. Id., at 130, 132. Glossip then dispatched\nSneed to buy plexiglass, which the pair installed over the\nbroken window on the morning of January 7.

Ante, at 5, n. 1. There is no contradiction in Sneed\u2019s claims\nthat he committed the murder as part of a robbery and that he did so to\navoid being \u201c \u2018evicted if Glossip lost his job.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. At both of Glossip\u2019s\ntrials, Sneed consistently testified that Glossip proposed taking the cash\nVan Treese had with him and that Glossip told him that they would get\nevicted if he did not kill Van Treese. 12 Tr. 95\u201396, 98, 124 (May 26,\n2004); 6 Tr. 89\u201390, 95\u201396 (June 8, 1998). Contemporaneous evidence\nsupports both motivations. In his confession to police, Sneed stated that\nGlossip had proposed killing Van Treese and taking the cash that Van\nTreese had with him. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2 App. 675</span><pre class=\"inline\">. And, two days after the murder, Glos-\nsip told police that Sneed had committed the murder in part because\n\u201c[h]e thought Barry [Van Treese] was going to throw him out in the\nstreet.\u201d Tr. of Glossip Police Interview 13 (Jan. 9, 1997). Nor did Sneed\never claim that \u201che did not know why Glossip wanted him to kill Van\nTreese.\u201d Ante, at 5, n. 1.

OKLAHOMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Glossip took additional steps to cover up the murder. He\ntold multiple witnesses that the window in Van Treese\u2019s\nroom was broken because two drunks had stayed there the\nnight before and smashed it in a brawl. 5 Tr. 85 (May 17,\n2004); 7 Tr. 64 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 46, 206 (May 21, 2004);\n11 Tr. 188\u2013189 (May 25, 2004). He told the housekeeper\nthat she did not need to clean the downstairs rooms\u2014in-\ncluding Van Treese\u2019s room. 8 Tr. 122\u2013123 (May 20, 2004).\nInstead, as Glossip explained to another employee and a\nmotel resident, he and Sneed would cover those rooms. 7\nTr. 64 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 49 (May 21, 2004). Glossip had\nnever taken such steps before. 8 Tr. 122\u2013123 (May 20,\n2004). He also told various witnesses that he had seen Van\nTreese alive and well around 7 o\u2019clock that morning. 4 Tr.\n99 (May 14, 2004); 7 Tr. 62\u201363 (May 19, 2004); 9 Tr. 194\n(May 21, 2004); 11 Tr. 126\u2013127, 182\u2013183 (May 25, 2004).\n  That afternoon, the credit union called the motel to report\nthat Van Treese\u2019s car had been abandoned in its parking\nlot. 7 Tr. 70 (May 19, 2004). At that point, it became clear\nto the motel\u2019s staff that Van Treese was missing. Id., at 72\u2013\n74. Shortly thereafter, Glossip returned to the motel from\na shopping trip, during which he had made several large\npurchases, including an engagement ring for his girlfriend.\nId., at 74; 14 Tr. 41 (May 28, 2004). He then purported to\nsearch the rooms and surrounding area for Van Treese. 5\nTr. 97 (May 17, 2004); 9 Tr. 192\u2013193 (May 21, 2004); 11 Tr.\n185\u2013186, 190 (May 25, 2004). He even assured Van\nTreese\u2019s wife over the phone that everything was fine and\nthat he had seen Van Treese that morning. 4 Tr. 99\u2013100\n(May 14, 2004).\n  Glossip later repeated to a local police officer the story\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGlossip wanted to kill Mr. Van Treese on this particular night,\u201d because\n\u201c[e]very time that Mr. Van Treese showed up, [Glossip] was wanting me\nto kill him.\u201d 6 Tr. 89 (June 8, 1998) (emphasis added). As noted, Sneed\nclearly testified at the same trial that Glossip wanted Sneed to kill Van\nTreese so that they would not be evicted.

Id., at 27\u201328, 69\u201370.\n   On the morning of January 8, Glossip began to sell all his\npossessions, telling multiple witnesses that he would like to\nleave town. 8 Tr. 88 (May 20, 2004); 11 Tr. 199 (May 25,\n2004). On January 9, police picked up Glossip after he\nfailed to appear for a meeting with homicide detectives. 12\nTr. 7 (May 26, 2004). He had $1,757 in cash on his person\nand no explanation for how he\u2014living paycheck to\npaycheck and having made only $490 from selling his pos-\nsessions the previous day\u2014had so much cash.

Tr. of Glossip Police Interview 1 (Jan.\n9, 1997). This time, although continuing to deny that he\nhad ordered Sneed to kill Van Treese, Glossip admitted that\nSneed had told him about the murder just after committing\nit, and that he had instructed Sneed to clean up the glass\nand repair the window. Id., at 13\u201314, 36. Glossip also ad-\nmitted that Van Treese \u201cwas upset because the motel\nwasn\u2019t doing as well as it could.\u201d Id., at 32. When asked\n\f6                   GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhy he hid the murder, Glossip denied doing so to protect\nSneed.

Were there any doubt\nabout Sneed\u2019s condition, records long available to both sides\nresolve it. In 1997, Sneed underwent a pretrial competency\nevaluation with forensic psychologist Dr. Edith King. Dr.\nKing\u2019s report strongly suggested that although Sneed him-\nself may have been in denial, he was taking lithium to treat\nbipolar disorder or a similar condition.

The second claim was that Smother-\nmon, the lead prosecutor, committed misconduct and vio-\nlated the rule of sequestration (which prohibits witnesses\nfrom hearing other witnesses\u2019 testimony) during trial. Af-\nter the State\u2019s forensic pathologist testified that there was\nevidence Sneed used a knife in addition to the bat during\nthe murder, Smothermon sent a memorandum to Sneed\u2019s\nattorney highlighting ways in which this testimony was\nhard to square with some of Sneed\u2019s earlier statements.\nGlossip thus claimed Smothermon violated the rule of se-\nquestration by conveying witness statements for the pur-\npose of coaching Sneed into altering his testimony to fit the\nforensic evidence. Attorney General John O\u2019Connor op-\nposed the application, urging the OCCA not to be cowed by\nthe ongoing \u201cpublic relations campaign\u201d to \u201cfalsely\u201d present\nGlossip as \u201cinnocent.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 App. 717</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n   The OCCA unanimously denied the application.

That concern\nis on full display here: Not a single merits brief in this case\ncites any of the decisions invoked by the majority for its\ngrand theory of confessions of error under Oklahoma law;\nthe majority developed it entirely sua sponte. Despite\nwrapping itself in the mantle of Long, the majority disre-\ngards one of its central teachings.\n   If we are to look at other OCCA decisions, I would start\nwith history that is more recent and more on point. In re-\nsponse to Glossip\u2019s fourth application for post-conviction re-\nlief, the State explicitly \u201cwaive[d] its right to argue the\nclaims within this . . . application are waived\u201d under the\nPCPA. 3 App. 717\u2013718. But, the OCCA refused to accept\nthe waiver, holding that \u201c[t]his Court alone will determine\nwhether the rules of this Court should be abandoned.\u201d Id.,\nat 775; see also ante, at 9. The OCCA thus made clear that\nit would apply the PCPA\u2019s procedural bars whether the\nState wanted it to or not. It makes no sense to say, just\nmonths later\u2014and in the same case\u2014that the OCCA re-\nversed course without explanation and decided that\n\u00a71089(D) becomes irrelevant when the State supports the\napplicant\u2019s claim for relief (while at the same time holding\nthat \u00a71089(D) applies). See ante, at 16. It should go with-\nout saying that a decision issued five months before the de-\ncision below in Glossip\u2019s own case sheds far more light on\nwhat the OCCA meant than decisions issued in different\ncases a century ago.\n   In any event, the majority vastly overreads the case law\nit cites. The decisions establish the modest point that a con-\nfession of error does not automatically entitle a defendant\nto relief; rather, the OCCA will independently \u201cexamine the\nrecord\u201d to ensure that the confession is \u201cwell founded in\nlaw.\u201d Raymer v.

So, even if Sneed said Dr.\nTrombka prescribed the lithium, that is no justification for inferring that\nhe communicated the reason for the prescription or the fact that Dr.\nTrombka is a psychiatrist.

In fact,\nthe evidence suggests the opposite; Smothermon clearly did not under-\nstand to whom Sneed was referring given that she mistook his name for\n\u201cTrumpet?\u201d See Figure 1, supra.

Where the jury does not\nrely on the false testimony because it is irrelevant, no such\ncorruption occurs.\n                              B\n  In any event, the majority fails its own test. Even fram-\ning the question as whether a correction could have affected\nthe outcome of trial, the parties have not established mate-\nriality.\n  First, irrespective of whether Sneed lied, prosecutorial\ncorrection of his testimony would not have led the jury to\ninfer that he had consciously committed perjury. The far\nmore plausible inference would have been that Sneed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The full context of Napue\u2019s materiality discussion further under-\n\nscores the decision\u2019s emphasis on the content of the false testimony ra-\nther than the effect of a counterfactual correction:\n   \u201cHad the jury been apprised of the true facts, however, it might well\nhave concluded that Hamer [the witness] had fabricated testimony in\norder to curry the favor of the very representative of the State who was\nprosecuting the case in which Hamer was testifying, for Hamer might\nhave believed that such a representative was in a position to implement\n(as he ultimately attempted to do) any promise of consideration. That\nthe Assistant State\u2019s Attorney himself thought it important to establish\nbefore the jury that no official source had promised Hamer consideration\nis made clear by his redirect examination, which was the last testimony\nof Hamer\u2019s heard by the jury:\n              .             .            .           .           .\n  \u201c[O]ur own evaluation of the record here compels us to hold that the\nfalse testimony used by the State in securing the conviction of petitioner\nmay have had an effect on the outcome of the trial.\u201d 360 U. S., at 270\u2013\n272.\n\f30                 GLOSSIP v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsimply misremembered\u2014like numerous other witnesses in\nthe same trial. Recall that Glossip\u2019s second trial took place\nseven years after the events in question and six years after\nhis first trial. Many key witnesses in Glossip\u2019s second trial\ntestified in his first, leaving them open to impeachment on\nany details they remembered differently six years later.\n   The record is replete with instances of counsel\u2014including\nthe prosecutors\u2014reminding the State\u2019s witnesses of facts\nthey had forgotten or misremembered. See, e.g., 5 Tr. 90\n(May 17, 2004); 7 Tr. 83\u201385 (May 19, 2004); 8 Tr. 40\u201342\n(May 20, 2004); 9 Tr. 100 (May 21, 2004); 10 Tr. 31 (May 24,\n2004); 14 Tr. 18 (May 28, 2004). Moreover, Sneed took lith-\nium for only a brief period in 1997. Considering that this\ntestimony held no significance for any contested issue at\ntrial, in this environment there is no reason to think its cor-\nrection would have been noteworthy, much less the voil\u00e0\nmoment the majority imagines.\n   Second, correcting Sneed\u2019s allegedly false statements\nwould not have led the jury to believe that Sneed\u2019s mental\ncondition led him to attack Van Treese on his own initia-\ntive. To begin with, the prosecution had no Napue obliga-\ntion to disclose that Sneed had bipolar disorder. Napue re-\nquires prosecutors \u201cto correct\u201d what they know to be \u201cfalse\ntestimony,\u201d not to proactively identify impeachment mate-\nrial. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105912\"><a href=\"/opinion/105912/napue-v-illinois/#265\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Napue v.

That state-\nment predated his plea agreement and so cannot be chalked\nup to trying to maintain his credibility on the stand. The\nOCCA thus reasonably found Sneed\u2019s statement about his\nown knowledge was not false. Nor did Sneed testify that he\nwas given lithium to treat a cold. See ante, at 23\u201324. He\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">604 U.

Sneed thus never falsely testified as\nto why he received lithium. And, without knowing why a\npsychiatrist prescribed lithium to Sneed, a lay jury would\nnot likely be able to attribute much significance to the mere\nfact that a psychiatrist did so.\n   Regardless, there is no reason to think that disclosing\nSneed\u2019s bipolar disorder would have affected the outcome of\nthe trial. Glossip\u2019s defense team was well aware of Sneed\u2019s\ncondition and chose not to use it as impeachment evidence.\nAs appellate judges examining a cold record 20 years after\nthe trial, we should be wary of believing that we understand\nthe import of evidence better than Glossip\u2019s counsel. More-\nover, the defense made no effort in its questions and argu-\nmentation to lay the groundwork for a theory that Sneed\nacted on a manic impulse. So, it is hard to see why the jury\nwould have developed any theory on its own from a cursory\nmention of the condition.\n   Finally, the Court cannot rescue its materiality analysis\nby invoking the cumulative-error doctrine. The Court as-\nserts with virtually no legal analysis that various other vi-\nolations of state and federal law undermine confidence in\nthe verdict. Ante, at 21\u201322. But, the cumulative-error doc-\ntrine applies only if there are multiple errors to consider cu-\nmulatively. See Wearry, 577 U.

The State\u2019s supposed violation\nof the rule of sequestration is a state-law issue over which\nwe have no jurisdiction. See 3 App. 780\u2013781. 8 The\nevidence-destruction claim is the majority\u2019s own creation.\nAlthough both parties mention alleged evidence destruction\nin the background statements of their briefs, neither argues\nto this Court that any destruction of evidence amounted to\na violation of federal law militating in favor of reversal. See\nBrief for Petitioner 33\u201338; Brief for Respondent 30\u201331. So\ntoo, there is no evidence that Sneed wished to \u201crecant\u201d his\ntestimony, ante, at 21; to the contrary, Sneed explained to\nReed Smith that \u201crecant[ing]\u201d was \u201cimpossible because I\ntold the truth,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 App. 724</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see also n. 2, supra (further explaining that Sneed has\nnever denied the truth of his testimony against Glossip).\nAnd, the claim that Glossip sold his couch and television for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority insists that the alleged violation of the rule of seques-\n\ntration is more than a state-law issue, ante, at 22, n. 9, but for support it\noffers only a case discussing \u201cthe ethical limits on guiding witnesses\u201d as\ndefined by the American Bar Association\u2019s model professional responsi-\nbility code for States, see Geders v.

Moreover, although the State has confessed a violation of\n\u201cthe rule of sequestration\u201d (without addressing the OCCA\u2019s earlier, con-\ntrary decision, see supra, at 10\u201311), it has not conceded that Smothermon\nimproperly influenced Sneed\u2019s testimony, see Brief for Respondent 13; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3\nApp. 978</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Such a claim is utterly unsupported. Glossip initially based\nthis accusation on \u201chandwritten notes\u201d found in a copy of Smothermon\u2019s\nletter to Sneed\u2019s attorney, which Glossip claimed were instructions from\nSmothermon on what Sneed was to say at trial. See Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 22\u20136500, p. 20. But, Glossip now concedes that those notes came\nfrom Sneed\u2019s attorney, not Smothermon. Brief for Petitioner 13, n. 4.\nDespite this concession, the majority asserts that Smothermon acted im-\nproperly when she stated at trial that, although she had spoken with\nSneed\u2019s attorney, she had never before heard him claim that he had at-\ntempted to stab Van Treese in the chest. Ante, at 22, n. 9 (citing 12 Tr.\n107\u2013108 (May 26, 2004)). The majority offers no evidence to suggest that\nthis statement was false. Yet, it insists on deeming Smothermon\u2019s con-\nduct a serious ethical breach.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">604 U.

The Court finds jurisdiction by invoking the Long\npresumption that a state court \u201creli[es] on federal law\u201d\nwhen it is \u201cinsufficiently \u2018clear from the face of the opinion\u2019 \u201d\nthat its decision rests on state law.

The OCCA\nshould have the chance to do so on remand.\n   In addition, in the proceedings below, only the State ar-\ngued that there was a Napue violation, and it is unclear\nwhether the State can raise a claim on a defendant\u2019s behalf.\nSee \u00a71089(A) (assuming that an \u201capplication for post-\nconviction relief \u201d comes from \u201ca defendant\u201d). Nor is it clear\nthat the State timely raised its Napue objection. State law\nrequired Glossip to file his application within 60 days of the\nState\u2019s disclosure of Box 8.

Here, by contrast, the Court has found jurisdic-\ntion only by applying the Long presumption; the case arises\nfrom a subsequent post-conviction application in a complex\nstate-law regime that imposes numerous procedural bars;\nthere are several state grounds that could foreclose relief\n\f40                 GLOSSIP v.

Further, although the new-trial order in Ake was\nlegally defensible, it was still a significant departure from\nordinary practice, which is to remand for further proceed-\nings even on direct review. See supra, at 34.\n   The majority further insists that no \u201cprecedent\u201d requires\na remand based on the Long presumption. Ante, at 28. It\nclaims that at most this Court has recognized the power of\nstate courts to \u201c \u2018grant relief to criminal defendants\u2019 \u201d under\nstate law after erroneously granting relief under federal\nlaw. Ibid. That assertion is incorrect. Evans recognized\nstate courts\u2019 power to reinstate their judgments after rever-\nsal as part of a general discussion of the Long presumption.\nSee 514 U. S., at 7\u20139. Its reasoning was not confined to the\nspecific context of a state court granting relief to a criminal\ndefendant. Similarly, treatise writers have recognized that\nstate courts can reinstate their judgments whenever this\nCourt \u201creview[s] an ambiguous decision.\u201d Hart &amp; Wechsler\n672. And, more fundamentally, when this Court asserts ju-\nrisdiction based on the Long presumption, \u201cwe merely as-\nsume that there are no [adequate and independent state]\ngrounds\u201d justifying the decision below; we do not conclu-\nsively decide that none exists. 463 U.

As I\nhave already explained, the precedents cited by the Court\ndo not support that proposition; they establish only that\ncourts have an independent duty to assess confessed errors\nfor themselves, which is nearly the opposite of the major-\nity\u2019s point. Supra, at 23\u201324. To make matters even more\nimplausible, the Court apparently interprets this principle\nto mean that a confession of error transforms a nonmerits\npreliminary proceeding into a merits proceeding where the\nOCCA can directly order ultimate relief. And, more im-\nportantly, it is for the OCCA to decide whether state law\nentitles Glossip to a new trial at this time, and it is absurd\nto think that the only conclusion the OCCA could reach is\nthe majority\u2019s.\n                              B\n   Even if we could blind ourselves to the foregoing proce-\ndural issues, Glossip would still be entitled to no more than\nan evidentiary hearing on his Napue claim. The Court says\nthat the facts \u201csupported by the record establish a violation\nof Napue,\u201d as though it were a trial court making findings\nafter an evidentiary hearing. Ante, at 29. That approach\ncannot possibly be right. The PCPA envisions that further\nproceedings are necessary if there are \u201ccontroverted, previ-\nously unresolved factual issues.\u201d \u00a71089(D)(5). On this rec-\nord, I do not see how one could conclude that there is not\neven a genuine issue of fact as to whether a Napue claim\nhas been established\u2014especially considering that Glossip\nhimself recognized below that, without further discovery,\nhis claims rested on \u201cspeculation.\u201d Motion for Evidentiary\nHearing, at 1\u20132.\n   Concluding that no new factual development is needed is\nparticularly inappropriate given the alternative reading of\nthe notes advanced by the Van Treese family in this Court.\nAs discussed above, the family has argued that the sup-\nposed \u201csmoking gun\u201d\u2014the notes from Box 8\u2014in fact reflects\n\f42                  GLOSSIP v.

If Sneed simply reported that he was asked about\nDr. Trombka without admitting Dr. Trombka prescribed\nhim lithium, Smothermon and Ackley would have had no\nreason to know that Dr. Trombka prescribed him lithium.\nAnd, the indication in Ackley\u2019s notes that Sneed apparently\nmentioned his \u201c \u2018tooth\u2019 \u201d being \u201c \u2018pulled\u2019 \u201d suggests that Sneed\nstood by his earlier story that he was mistakenly prescribed\nlithium when his tooth was pulled. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">3 App. 940</span><pre class=\"inline\">; see 2 id., at\n700 (Sneed\u2019s earlier statement).\n   Given the existence of a plausible alternative interpreta-\ntion of the evidence, I would not order a new trial at this\ntime even if we had discretion to do so.

If the evidence is as decisive as the ma-\njority believes, Glossip would still receive a new trial. There\nis no excuse for denying the Van Treese family its day in\ncourt.\n   After having bent the law at every turn to grant relief to\nGlossip, the Court suddenly retreats to faux formalism\nwhen dealing with the victim\u2019s family. The Court concludes\nthat it need not honor the family\u2019s right to be heard because\nthe family did not request an evidentiary hearing earlier in\nthe proceedings. Ante, at 27, n. 11.

And, before\nthis Court, the Van Treese family has vigorously asserted\nits interests. The family filed the only brief opposing certi-\norari in this case. See Brief for Victim Family Members\net al. as Amici Curiae in Opposition. It filed a merits brief\nhighlighting critical evidence that the parties sought to\nsweep under the rug.

Finally, even if the family had no formal right to\nbe heard, any reasonable factfinder plainly could consider\nthe account of the evidence that the family has brought to\nlight, making the majority\u2019s procedural objections beside\nthe point.
