Argued October 3, 2023\u2014Decided May 16, 2024\nThe Constitution gives Congress control over the public fsc subject to the\n  command that \u201c[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in\n  Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. For\n  most federal agencies, Congress provides funding through annual appro-\n  priations. For the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, however,\n  Congress provided a standing source of funding outside the ordinary\n  annual appropriations process. Specifcally, Congress authorized the\n  Bureau to draw from the Federal Reserve System an amount that its\n  Director deems \u201creasonably necessary to carry out\u201d the Bureau's duties,\n  subject only to an infation-adjusted cap. 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 5497(a)(1), (2).\n  In this case, several trade associations representing payday lenders and\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  credit-access businesses challenged regulations issued by the Bureau\n  pertaining to high-interest consumer loans on statutory and constitu-\n  tional grounds. As relevant here, the Fifth Circuit accepted the associ-\n  ations' argument that the Bureau's funding mechanism violates the Ap-\n  propriations Clause.\nHeld: Congress' statutory authorization allowing the Bureau to draw money\n from the earnings of the Federal Reserve System to carry out the Bu-\n reau's duties satisfes the Appropriations Clause. Pp. 424\u2013438, 441.\n    (a) Under the Appropriations Clause, an appropriation is a law that\n authorizes expenditures from a specifed source of public money for des-\n ignated purposes. Pp. 424\u2013435.\n       (1) The Bureau's funding is \u201cdrawn from the Treasury\u201d and is\n therefore subject to the requirements of the Appropriations Clause.\n The issue is whether the Bureau's funding mechanism constitutes an\n \u201cAppropriatio[n] made by Law.\u201d The Court concludes that the answer\n is yes based on the Constitution's text, the history against which that\n text was enacted, and congressional practice immediately following rati-\n fcation. Pp. 425\u2013434.\n       (i) The Constitution's use of the term \u201cappropriation\u201d provides im-\n portant insight into its meaning. The Appropriations Clause itself\n specifes that an appropriation must authorize withdrawals from a par-\n ticular source, the \u201cTreasury.\u201d And, the proviso limiting Congress'\n\f                      Cite as: 601 U. S. 416 (2024)                    417\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n power to \u201craise and support Armies\u201d\u2014that \u201cno Appropriation of Money\n to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years\u201d\u2014indicates that\n appropriations assign funds for specifc uses. Contemporary dictionary\n defnitions support this conclusion as well. The evidence suggests that,\n at a minimum, appropriations were understood as a legislative means\n of authorizing expenditures from public funds for designated purposes.\n Pp. 426\u2013427.\n      (ii) Pre-founding history supports the conclusion that an identifed\n source and purpose are all that is required for a valid appropriation.\n The concept of legislative appropriations grew out of the broader strug-\n gle between Parliament and the Crown for popular control of the purse\n in England. Parliament had little claim to direct how the Crown's he-\n reditary revenues were spent, but \u201cextraordinary revenues\u201d required\n parliamentary authorization because they were fnanced through vari-\n ous forms of taxation. In granting these revenues, Parliament began\n exercising an attendant power to specify how the Crown used the funds.\n The ensuing power struggle culminated in Parliament stripping away\n the remnants of the Crown's hereditary revenues. Subsequently, Par-\n liament's usual practice was to appropriate government revenue to par-\n ticular purposes and to limit the duration of its revenue grants. But,\n not all appropriations were time limited. Some statutes granting\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n money gave the Crown broad discretion regarding how much to spend\n within an appropriated sum.\n      The appropriations practice in the Colonies and early state legisla-\n tures was much the same. Many early state constitutions vested the\n legislative body with power over appropriations, and state legislative\n bodies often opted for open-ended, discretionary appropriations. By\n the time of the Constitutional Convention, it was uncontroversial that\n the powers to raise and disburse public money would reside in the Leg-\n islative Branch. The origins of the Appropriations Clause confrm that\n appropriations needed to designate particular revenues for identifed\n purposes, but beyond that limit, early legislative bodies exercised a wide\n range of discretion. Pp. 427\u2013432.\n      (iii) The practice of the First Congress also illustrates the source-\n and-purpose understanding of appropriations. Many early appropria-\n tions laws made annual lump-sum grants for the Government's ex-\n penses. As in England, the appropriation of \u201csums not exceeding\u201d a\n specifed amount provided the Executive discretion over how much to\n spend up to a cap. Congress took even more fexible approaches to\n appropriations for several early executive agencies, allowing them to\n indefnitely fund themselves from revenue collected. For example,\n Congress adopted open-ended fee- and commission-based funding\n schemes for Customs Service and the Post Offce. Pp. 432\u2013434.\n\f418 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                       Syllabus\n\n        (2) The Bureau's funding statute satisfes the requirements of the\n Appropriations Clause. The statute authorizes the Bureau to draw\n public funds from a particular source\u2014\u201cthe combined earnings of the\n Federal Reserve System\u201d\u2014 in an amount not exceeding an infation-\n adjusted cap. 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 5497(a)(1), (2)(A)\u2013(B). And, it specifes the\n objects for which the Bureau can use those funds\u2014to \u201cpay the expenses\n of the Bureau in carrying out its duties and responsibilities.\u201d\n \u00a7 5497(c)(1). The Bureau's funding mechanism also fts comfortably\n within the historical appropriations practice described above. P. 435.\n     (b) The associations' three principal arguments for why the Bureau's\n funding mechanism violates the Appropriations Clause are unpersua-\n sive. Pp. 435\u2013438.\n        (1) The associations argue that the Bureau's funding is not \u201cdrawn\n . . . in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law\u201d because the agency\n itself decides the amount of annual funding to draw from the Federal\n Reserve System. But, appropriations of \u201csums not exceeding\u201d a cer-\n tain amount were commonplace immediately after the founding. Con-\n gress did not violate the Appropriations Clause by permitting the\n Bureau to decide how much funding to draw up to a cap. Pp. 435\u2013436.\n        (2) The associations suggest that the Appropriations Clause re-\n\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n quires both Chambers of Congress to periodically agree on an agency's\n funding, which ensures that each Chamber reserves the power to unilat-\n erally block those funding measures through inaction. While the Con-\n stitution expressly provides that \u201cno Appropriation of Money\u201d to sup-\n port an army \u201cshall be for a longer Term than two Years,\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 8,\n cl. 12, the Constitution does not explicitly limit the duration of appropri-\n ations for other purposes. The First Congress' practice confrms this\n understanding, as appropriations that supplied funding to the Customs\n Service and the Post Offce were not time limited. The associations\n resist the analogy to the Post Offce and other fee-based agencies, ar-\n guing that such agencies do not enjoy the same level of fscal independ-\n ence as the Bureau. But, the associations fail to explain the relevance\n of that difference to the question whether a law complies with the con-\n stitutional imperative of an appropriation. Pp. 436\u2013437.\n        (3) Finally, the associations contend that if the Bureau's funding\n mechanism is consistent with the Appropriations Clause, then Congress\n could do the same for any\u2014or every\u2014civilian agency, allowing the Ex-\n ecutive to operate free of any meaningful fscal check. But, the Appro-\n priations Clause is simply a limitation on Congress' power over the\n purse, and the associations err by reducing the power of the purse to\n only the principle expressed in the Appropriations Clause. They offer\n no defensible argument that the Appropriations Clause requires more\n\f                       Cite as: 601 U.

The Appropriations Clause commands that\n\u201c[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Conse-\nquence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.\nFor most federal agencies, Congress provides funding on an\nannual basis. This annual process forces them to regularly\nimplore Congress to fund their operations for the next year.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is different.\nThe Bureau does not have to petition for funds each year.\nInstead, Congress authorized the Bureau to draw from the\nFederal Reserve System the amount its Director deems\n\u201creasonably necessary to carry out\u201d the Bureau's duties, sub-\nject only to an infation-adjusted cap. 124 Stat. 1975, 12\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 5497(a)(1), (2). In this case, we must decide the\nnarrow question whether this funding mechanism complies\nwith the Appropriations Clause. We hold that it does.\n\n                                    I\n                          A\nPage     Proof      Pending        Publication\n Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act in response to the 2008 fnancial\ncrisis. 124 Stat. 1376. The Act created an independent\nfinancial regulator within the Federal Reserve System\nknown as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. 12\nU. S. C. \u00a7 5491(a). Congress charged the Bureau with en-\nforcing consumer fnancial protection laws to ensure \u201cthat\nall consumers have access to markets for consumer fnancial\nproducts and services and that markets for consumer fnan-\ncial products and services are fair, transparent, and competi-\ntive.\u201d \u00a7 5511(a).

OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nauthority to administer 18 existing consumer protection stat-\nutes, among them the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the\nFair Credit Reporting Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclo-\nsure Act of 1975. \u00a7\u00a7 5512(a), 5481(12), (14). Additionally,\nthe Act made it unlawful for those offering consumer fnan-\ncial products and services \u201cto engage in any unfair, decep-\ntive, or abusive act or practice.\u201d \u00a7 5536(a)(1)(B). Congress\nvested the Bureau with rulemaking, enforcement, and adju-\ndicatory authority over the statutes that it administers.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7 5531(a)\u2013(b), 5581(a)(1)(A), (b) (rulemaking authority);\n\u00a7\u00a7 5562\u20135565 (enforcement and adjudicatory authority).\n   In addition to vesting the Bureau with sweeping authority,\nCongress shielded the Bureau from the infuence of the polit-\nical branches. To insulate the Bureau from the President's\ncontrol, Congress put a single Director with a 5-year term\nat the Bureau's helm and made the Director removable only\nfor ineffciency, neglect, or malfeasance. \u00a7\u00a7 5491(b)\u2013(c).\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nThis Court held in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Finan-\ncial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. 197 (2020), that the\ncombination of single-Director leadership and for-cause re-\nmoval protection unconstitutionally circumscribed the Pres-\nident's ability to oversee the Executive Branch. Id.,\nat 208.\n   This case involves another one of the Bureau's novel struc-\ntural features, one that limits Congress' control. Congress\nsupplies most federal agencies with the funds necessary for\ntheir operations only on an annual basis, so those agencies\nmust ask Congress for renewed funding each year. For the\nBureau, however, Congress diminished this accountability by\nproviding the Bureau a standing source of funding outside\nthe ordinary annual appropriations process. Each year, the\nBureau may requisition from the earnings of the Federal Re-\nserve System \u201cthe amount determined by the [Bureau's] Di-\nrector to be reasonably necessary to carry out\u201d its duties,\nsubject only to a statutory cap. \u00a7 5497(a)(1). The Bureau\ncannot request more than 12 percent of the Federal Reserve\n\f                  Cite as: 601 U.

In fscal\nyear 2022, that cap was about $734 million. See Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, Financial Report of the Con-\nsumer Financial Protection Bureau 7 (Fiscal year 2022).\nThe Bureau can also retain and invest unused funds from\nyear to year, though the Director must take into account\nany surplus when requesting additional funds. \u00a7\u00a7 5497(a)(1),\n(b)(3), (c).\n                              B\n  In 2017, the Bureau promulgated a regulation focused on\nhigh-interest consumer loans. See Payday, Vehicle Title,\nand Certain High-Cost Installment Loans, 12 CFR pt. 1041\n(2018) (Payday Lending Rule). Among other things, the\nregulation restricts lenders' ability to obtain loan payments\nthrough preauthorized account access after two unsuccess-\nful withdrawal attempts. Ibid. The Community Financial\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nServices Association of America and Consumer Service Alli-\nance of Texas, trade associations that represent payday lend-\ners and credit-access businesses, challenged the Payday\nLending Rule on statutory and constitutional grounds. In\nthe operative complaint, the associations argued, among\nother things, that the Bureau \u201ctakes federal government\nmoney without an appropriations act\u201d in violation of the\nAppropriations Clause. Amended Complaint in No. 1:18\u2013\ncv\u201300295 (WD Tex.), ECF Doc. 76, p. 30.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Bu-\nreau. As relevant, the court explained that \u201c[t]he Appropri-\nations Clause `means simply that no money can be paid out\nof the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of\nCongress.' \u201d 558 F. Supp. 3d 350, 364 (WD Tex. 2021) (quot-\ning Offce of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S.\n414, 424 (1990)). And, because \u201ca statute authorizes\u201d the\ndisbursements from the Federal Reserve System's combined\nearnings to the Bureau \u201cup to a certain cap,\u201d the District\nCourt concluded, \u201cthere is no Appropriations Clause issue.\u201d\n\f424 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n558 F. Supp. 3d, at 364. On appeal, the associations renewed\ntheir argument that the \u201cBureau's funding mechanism\nusurps Congress's role in the appropriation of federal funds\u201d\nby allowing it to take \u201cfederal money without an appropria-\ntions act.\u201d Brief for Appellants in No. 21\u201350826 (CA5),\np. 28.\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with this argument and re-\nversed. 51 F. 4th 616 (CA5 2022). Drawing on the Consti-\ntution's text and history, the court concluded that the Appro-\npriations Clause \u201cdoes more than reinforce Congress's power\nover fscal matters; it affrmatively obligates Congress to use\nthat authority `to maintain the boundaries between the\nbranches and preserve individual liberty from the encroach-\nments of executive power.' \u201d Id., at 637 (quoting Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau v. All Am. Check Cashing,\nInc., 33 F. 4th 218, 231 (CA5 2022) (en banc) (Jones, J., concur-\nring)). By giving the Bureau a \u201cself-actualizing, perpetual\nfunding mechanism,\u201d the court reasoned, Congress in effect\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nabandoned this obligation. 51 F. 4th, at 638\u2013639. It was\nnot enough that Congress enacted the law authorizing the\nBureau's funding because a \u201claw alone does not suffce\u2014an\nappropriation is required.\u201d Id., at 640. The court thus\nheld that the Bureau's funding mechanism violates the\nAppropriations Clause.

We\nnow reverse.\n                                II\n  Under the Appropriations Clause, an appropriation is sim-\nply a law that authorizes expenditures from a specifed\nsource of public money for designated purposes. The stat-\nute that provides the Bureau's funding meets these require-\nments. We therefore conclude that the Bureau's funding\nmechanism does not violate the Appropriations Clause.\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

Whatever the scope of the term \u201cTreasury\u201d\nin the Appropriations Clause, money otherwise destined for\nthe general fund of the Treasury qualifes. The Bureau's\nfunding is therefore subject to the requirements of the Ap-\npropriations Clause.\n   The associations' challenge turns solely on whether the\nBureau's funding mechanism constitutes an \u201cAppropriatio[n]\nmade by Law.\u201d This question divided the courts below.\nThe District Court concluded that a valid appropriation is\nnothing more than a statute that \u201cauthorizes an agency to\nreceive funds up to a certain cap.\u201d 558 F. Supp. 3d, at 364;\n\f426 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN.

The associations de-\nfend this understanding and argue that the statute that pro-\nvides the Bureau's funding undermines these aims by\nallowing the agency to indefnitely choose its own level of\nannual funding, subject only to an illusory cap. That is, the\nassociations contend that the Bureau's funding mechanism is\ntoo open-ended in duration and amount to satisfy the re-\nquirement that there be an \u201cAppropriatio[n] made by Law.\u201d\n   Based on the Constitution's text, the history against which\nthat text was enacted, and congressional practice immedi-\nately following ratifcation, we conclude that appropriations\nneed only identify a source of public funds and authorize the\nexpenditure of those funds for designated purposes to satisfy\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthe Appropriations Clause.\n                              1\n   The Constitution's text requires an \u201cAppropriatio[n] made\nby Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Our concern is principally with\nthe meaning of the word \u201cappropriation.\u201d The Constitu-\ntion's use of the term \u201cappropriation\u201d in the Appropriations\nClause and in other Clauses provides important contextual\nclues about its meaning. To state the obvious, the Appro-\npriations Clause itself makes clear that an appropriation\nmust authorize withdrawals from a particular source\u2014the\npublic treasury. It provides that money may be \u201cdrawn\nfrom the Treasury\u201d only \u201cin Consequence of Appropriations\nmade by Law.\u201d Ibid. The section preceding the Appropri-\nations Clause further suggests that appropriations assign\nfunds for specifc uses: Congress has the power to \u201craise and\nsupport Armies,\u201d but subject to the limitation that \u201cno Ap-\npropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term\nthan two Years.\u201d \u00a7 8, cl. 12.\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language (1828); see\nalso 1 J.

Pardon, A\nNew General English Dictionary (14th ed. 1771) (\u201cthe ap-\npointing a thing to a particular use\u201d). In ordinary usage,\nthen, an appropriation of public money would be a law au-\nthorizing the expenditure of particular funds for specifed\nends.\n   Taken as a whole, this evidence suggests that, at a mini-\nmum, appropriations were understood as a legislative means\nof authorizing expenditure from a source of public funds for\ndesignated purposes.\nPage Proof Pending Publication 2\n   Pre-founding history supports the conclusion that an iden-\ntifed source and purpose are all that is required for a valid\nappropriation. The concept of legislative \u201cappropriations\u201d\ngrew out of the broader struggle for popular control of the\npurse in England. Throughout the Middle Ages, the King\nenjoyed near total fscal independence. At that time, the\nKing's revenues came largely from hereditary sources, some-\ntimes called \u201cordinary\u201d revenues. 1 W. Blackstone, Com-\nmentaries on the Laws of England 281 (1771) (Commentar-\nies). These ordinary revenues fowed from many sources,\nincluding the \u201crents and profts of the demesne lands of the\ncrown,\u201d id., at 286, and the fnes, forfeitures, and fees \u201caris-\ning from the king's ordinary courts of justice,\u201d id., at 289.\nBecause this revenue inhered in the King himself, Parlia-\nment had little claim to direct how it was spent. See F.\nMaitland, The Constitutional History of England 430 (1908)\n(Maitland).\n\f428 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   But, when these unencumbered ordinary revenues did not\nsatisfy the demands of royal governance, most often during\nwartime, the King had to seek what Blackstone called \u201cex-\ntraordinary revenue.\u201d Commentaries 306. Extraordinary\nrevenues were fnanced through various forms of taxation\nand therefore required parliamentary authorization. Id., at\n169, 307; see Magna Charta, ch. 12 (1215), in A. Howard,\nMagna Carta: Text and Commentary 40 (rev. ed. 1998). In\ngranting extraordinary revenues, Parliament began exercis-\ning an attendant power to specify how the Crown used these\nfunds. Maitland 183\u2013184; see also T. Taswell-Langmead,\nEnglish Constitutional History: From the Teutonic Conquest\nto the Present Time 219, 229 (6th ed. 1905). That is, Parlia-\nment \u201cclaimed the power to appropriate the supplies granted\nto the king.\u201d Maitland 183\u2013184.\n   Conditions in the 17th century shifted the balance of\npower toward Parliament. A combination of rising prices\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nand increasing demands made it so that the King's ordinary\nrevenues could not satisfy the costs of royal governance,\neven in times of peace. D. Keir, The Constitutional History\nof Modern Britain Since 1485, pp. 180\u2013181 (6th ed. 1960);\nP. Einzig, The Control of the Purse 57 (1959). The King's\nfnancial weakness, and Parliament's increasing assertive-\nness in appropriating extraordinary revenues, led to intra-\ngovernmental strife. The ensuing power struggle culmi-\nnated in the Glorious Revolution, in which Parliament\nstripped away the remnants of the King's hereditary reve-\nnues and thereby secured supremacy in fscal matters.\nCommentaries 306, 333; Maitland 434.\n   Following the Glorious Revolution, Parliament's usual\npractice was to appropriate government revenue \u201cto particu-\nlar purposes more or less narrowly defned.\u201d Id., at 433.\nAdditionally, Parliament began limiting the duration of its\nrevenue grants. For example, the duties on tonnage and\npoundage were no longer granted to the King for life, but\nonly for a term of years. See 2 Wm. & Mary, c. 4, \u00a7 1 (1690);\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U. S. 416 (2024)             429\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n6 Wm. & Mary, c. 1, \u00a7 1 (1694); see also D. Gill, The Treasury,\n1660\u20131714, 46 Eng. Hist. Rev. 600, 610 (1931). Limiting the\nduration of these and other revenue grants ensured that the\nKing could not rule without Parliament. As one historian\ndescribed it, Parliament made sure \u201cthe Crown should be\naltogether unable to pay its way without an annual meeting\nof Parliament. . . . Every year he and his Ministers had to\ncome, cap in hand, to the House of Commons, and more often\nthan not the Commons drove a bargain and exacted a quid\npro quo in return for supply.\u201d G. Trevelyan, The English\nRevolution 1688\u20131689, pp. 180\u2013181 (1939).\n   Even with this newfound fscal supremacy, Parliament did\nnot micromanage every aspect of the King's fnances. Not\nall post-Glorious Revolution grants of supplies were time\nlimited. A notable exception involved what came to be\nknown as the civil list. Despite its established power to\nlimit the duration of revenue grants, Parliament deemed it\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nproper to cover the expenses of the King's household and the\ncivil government by appropriating revenue to that purpose\nfor life. Maitland 435\u2013436; see also E. Reitan, The Civil List\nin Eighteenth-Century British Politics, 9 Hist. J. 318, 319\n(1966) (Reitan) (explaining that the \u201cCrown was to meet the\ncosts of the civil government\u201d out of the civil list, including\n\u201cthe fees and salaries of the ministers and many other public\noffcers, the salaries of many of the small fry in various gov-\nernment departments, the salaries and pensions of judges,\nthe salaries and allowances of ambassadors and consuls, and\nthe maintenance of buildings for Parliament and the public\noffces\u201d). And, parliamentary grants of supplies ordinarily\ngave the Crown broad discretion regarding how much to\nspend within an appropriated sum. Statutes granting\nmoney often stated that the Crown could spend \u201cany Sum\nnot exceeding\u201d a particular amount. See, e.g., 13 Anne,\nc. 18, \u00a7 69 (1713); 1 Anne, c. 6, \u00a7 130 (1702). These grants\nwere permissive. As Maitland explained, \u201cMoney is granted\nto the queen; it is placed at the disposal of her and her minis-\n\f430 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nters. But she and they are not bound by law to spend it, at\nleast not bound by the Appropriation Act.\u201d Maitland 445.\nOther parliamentary appropriations acts, however, required\nthat money be spent for particular purposes. See, e.g., 2\nWm. & Mary, c. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 35\u201336 (1690); 3 Wm. & Mary, c. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 42\u2013\n43 (1691); see also M. Rappaport, The Selective Nondelega-\ntion Doctrine and the Line Item Veto, 76 Tulane L. Rev. 265,\n327, n. 211 (2001) (Rappaport).\n   The appropriations practice in the Colonies and early state\nlegislatures was much the same. \u201cWhen called upon to\ngrant supplies,\u201d the lower houses in the colonial assemblies\n\u201cinsisted upon appropriating them in detail.\u201d J. Greene,\nThe Quest for Power: The Lower Houses of Assembly in the\nSouthern Royal Colonies 1689\u20131776, p. 88 (1963). Many\nearly state constitutions vested the legislative body with\npower over appropriations. Rappaport 332\u2013333. And, in\nexercising that authority, state legislative bodies often opted\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nfor open-ended, discretionary appropriations. See, e.g., Act\nof Mar. 31, 1788, 1787 Mass. Acts and Laws ch. 63, p. 657\n(\u201c[T]he amount of all duties collected by virtue of this Act\nshall be, and is hereby appropriated to & for the support of\nthe civil government of this Commonwealth\u201d); Act of Nov.\n17, 1786, 1786 Mass.

It was uncontrover-\nsial that the powers to raise and disburse public money\nwould reside in the Legislative Branch. The only disagree-\nment was about whether the right to originate taxation and\nappropriations bills should rest in a legislative body with\nproportionate representation. Having reached a tentative\nagreement on that difference, the Committee of Detail re-\nported a draft constitution giving the House of Representa-\ntives the power to originate all revenue and appropriations\nlaws. This proposed draft contained the prototype of what\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nlater became the Appropriations Clause. It provided that\n\u201c[a]ll bills for raising or appropriating money . . . shall origi-\nnate in the House of Representatives, and shall not be al-\ntered or amended by the Senate. No money shall be drawn\nfrom the public Treasury, but in pursuance of appropriations\nthat shall originate in the House of Representatives.\u201d 2\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 178 (M. Far-\nrand ed. 1911). Ultimately, the Convention agreed to grant\nthe House an exclusive power to originate revenue laws but\nnot for appropriations laws. Compare Art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 1, with\n\u00a7 9, cl. 7.\n   In short, the origins of the Appropriations Clause confrm\nthat appropriations needed to designate particular revenues\nfor identifed purposes. Beyond that, however, early legis-\nlative bodies exercised a wide range of discretion. Some ap-\npropriations required expenditure of a particular amount,\nwhile others allowed the recipient of the appropriated money\nto spend up to a cap. Some appropriations were time lim-\n\f432 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN.

And, the specifcity with which ap-\npropriations designated the objects of the expenditures var-\nied greatly.\n                             3\n   The practice of the First Congress also illustrates the\nsource-and-purpose understanding of appropriations. This\npractice \u201cprovides contemporaneous and weighty evidence of\nthe Constitution's meaning.\u201d Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.\n714, 723 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Many early appropriations laws made annual lump-sum\ngrants for the Government's expenses. Congress' frst an-\nnual appropriations law, for instance, divided Government\nexpenditures into four broad categories and authorized dis-\nbursements up to certain amounts for those purposes. For\nexample, the law appropriated a \u201csum not exceeding two\nhundred and sixteen thousand dollars for defraying the ex-\npenses of the civil list,\u201d which covered most nonmilitary ex-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\necutive offcers' salaries and expenses. Act of Sept. 29,\n1789, ch. 23, 1 Stat. 95; see 5 Papers of Alexander Hamilton\n381\u2013388 (H. Syrett & J. Cooke eds. 1962) (reporting detailed\nline-item estimates for civil-list expenditures). And, it ap-\npropriated \u201ca sum not exceeding one hundred and thirty-\nseven thousand dollars for defraying the expenses of the de-\npartment of war.\u201d 1 Stat. 95. The law specifed that the\ndisbursements would \u201cbe paid out of the monies which arise,\neither from the requisitions heretofore made upon the sev-\neral states, or from the duties on impost and tonnage.\u201d\nIbid. Subsequent annual appropriations laws followed a\nsimilar pattern. See Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 4, 1 Stat. 104;\nAct of Feb. 11, 1791, ch. 6, 1 Stat. 190; Act of Dec. 23, 1791,\nch. 3, 1 Stat. 226.\n   The appropriation of \u201csums not exceeding\u201d a specifed\namount did not by itself mandate that the Executive spend\nthat amount; as was the case in England, such appropriations\ninstead provided the Executive discretion over how much to\nspend up to a cap. In 1803, for instance, Congress appro-\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

President Jefferson subsequently reported, how-\never, that \u201c[t]he sum of ffty thousand dollars appropriated\nby Congress for providing gun boats remains unexpended.\nThe favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi\nrendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary.\u201d\n13 Annals of Cong. 14 (1803).\n   Congress took even more fexible approaches to appropria-\ntions for several early executive agencies and allowed the\nagencies to indefnitely fund themselves directly from reve-\nnue collected. Soon after convening, Congress enacted laws\nthat imposed a detailed schedule of duties on imported goods\nand tonnage. See Act of July 4, 1789, ch. 2, 1 Stat. 24\u201327\n(imposing duties on imported goods, wares, and merchan-\ndises); Act of July 20, 1789, ch. 3, 1 Stat. 27\u201328 (imposing\nduties on tonnage). It then divided the Nation into customs\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndistricts and established a vast federal bureaucracy to over-\nsee the collection of those duties. Act of July 31, 1789,\nch. 5, 1 Stat. 29\u201349. Rather than fund those customs off-\ncials through annual appropriations, Congress opted for a\nfee-based model. Customs collectors were compensated\nthrough tonnage- and transaction-based fees specifed by law,\nand through a commission on the amount of duties raised\nwithin their districts. For example, customs collectors were\nentitled to collect from merchants two-and-a-half dollars \u201cfor\nevery entrance of any ship or vessel of one hundred tons\nburthen or upwards\u201d and 20 cents \u201cfor every permit to land\ngoods.\u201d Id., at 44. And, collectors in the largest ports\nwere paid \u201chalf a per centum on the amount of all monies by\nthem respectively received and paid into the treasury of the\nUnited States.\u201d Id., at 45. Other customs functionaries\nwere also compensated on a fee basis. For instance, cus-\ntoms collectors paid weighers 18 cents \u201cout of the revenue\u201d\ncollected \u201cfor the measurement of every one hundred bushels\nof salt or grain.\u201d Ibid.\n\f434 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   Congress adopted a similarly open-ended funding scheme\nfor the Post Offce. Instead of appropriating funds on an\nannual basis, Congress authorized the Postmaster General to\n\u201cdefray the expense\u201d of carrying the mail of the United\nStates with the revenues generated through postage assess-\nments. Act of Feb. 20, 1792, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. 234. The postal\nstatute also provided the Postmaster General a $2,000 annual\nsalary \u201cto be paid . . . out of the revenues of the post-offce.\u201d\n\u00a7 8, id., at 235. And, it authorized the Postmaster General\nto pay deputy postmasters \u201csuch commission on the monies\narising from the postage of letters and packets, as he shall\nthink adequate to their respective services,\u201d subject to an\nupper limit. \u00a7 23, id., at 238. These fee-based funding\nschemes continued year after year without Congress passing\nan annual appropriation for these agencies.\n   These fee- and commission-based funding schemes were\nnot an American innovation; they emulated the colonial pre-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ncursors to the Customs Service and Post Offce. Colonial\ncustoms offcers, for instance, \u201cwere paid a percentage of\ntotal receipts in their area, the proportion varying from col-\nony to colony depending on the estimated potential yield.\u201d\nT. Barrow, Trade and Empire: The British Customs Service\nin Colonial America 1660\u20131775, p. 14 (1967). Although the\ncustoms service in the Colonies later transitioned to a salary\nsystem, each customs \u201coffcial was allowed certain fees for\nalmost every transaction.\u201d Id., at 78. And, as to the postal\nservice, the Continental Congress allowed postmaster depu-\nties 20 percent \u201con the sums they collect and pay into the\nGeneral post offce annually,\u201d up to $1,000, and 10 percent\non sums over that amount. 2 Journals of the Continental\nCongress, 1774\u20131789, p. 208 (W. Ford ed. 1905).\n   Postratifcation practice therefore confrms our interpreta-\ntion of the Appropriations Clause. Early appropriations\ndisplayed signifcant variety in their structure. Each, how-\never, adhered to the minimum requirements of an identifable\nsource of public funds and purpose.\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

In design,\nthe Bureau's authorization to draw an amount that the Direc-\ntor deems reasonably necessary to carry out the agency's\nresponsibilities, subject to a cap, is similar to the First Con-\ngress' lump-sum appropriations. And, the commission- and\nfee-based appropriations that supplied the Customs Service\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nand Post Offce provided standing authorizations to expend\npublic money in the same way that the Bureau's funding\nmechanism does.\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the statute that au-\nthorizes the Bureau to draw funds from the combined earn-\nings of the Federal Reserve System is an \u201cAppropriatio[n]\nmade by Law.\u201d We therefore hold that the requirements of\nthe Appropriations Clause are satisfed.\n\n                               III\n  The associations make three principal arguments for why\nthe Bureau's funding mechanism violates the Appropriations\nClause, each of which attempts to build additional require-\nments into the meaning of an \u201cAppropriatio[n] made by\nLaw.\u201d None is persuasive.\n\n                                A\n  At the outset, the associations argue that the Bureau's\nfunding is not \u201cdrawn . . . in Consequence of Appropriations\n\f436 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nmade by Law\u201d because the agency, rather than Congress,\ndecides the amount of annual funding that it draws from the\nFederal Reserve System. This argument proceeds from a\nmistaken premise. Congress determined the amount of the\nBureau's annual funding by imposing a statutory cap. The\nBureau's funding statute provides that \u201cthe amount that\nshall be transferred to the Bureau in each fscal year shall\nnot exceed\u201d 12 percent \u201cof the total operating expenses of\nthe Federal Reserve System\u201d as reported in 2009 and ad-\njusted for infation. \u00a7 5497(a)(2). The only sense in which\nthe Bureau decides its own funding, then, is by exercising its\ndiscretion to draw less than the statutory cap. But, as we\nhave explained, \u201csums not exceeding\u201d appropriations, which\nprovided the Executive with the same discretion, were com-\nmonplace immediately after the founding. Supra, at 432\u2013\n433. Thus, we cannot conclude that Congress violated the\nAppropriations Clause by permitting the Bureau to decide\nhow much funding to draw up to a cap.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n                               B\n   Next, the associations suggest that the Bureau's funding\nstatute is not a valid appropriation because it is not time\nlimited. On their reading, the Appropriations Clause re-\nquires both Chambers of Congress to periodically agree on\nan agency's funding, which ensures that each Chamber re-\nserves the power to unilaterally block those funding meas-\nures through inaction. The Bureau's funding mechanism,\nthe associations insist, inverts this baseline by allowing it to\ndraw funds\u2014forever\u2014unless both Chambers of Congress\nstep in and affrmatively prevent the agency from doing so.\n   But, the Constitution's text suggests that, at least in some\ncircumstances, Congress can make standing appropriations.\nThe Constitution expressly provides that \u201cno Appropriation\nof Money\u201d to support an army \u201cshall be for a longer Term\nthan two Years.\u201d Art.

The Framers were thus aware of the dy-\nnamic that the associations highlight, but they did not explic-\nitly limit the duration of appropriations for other purposes.\n    The First Congress' practice confrms this understanding.\nRecall that the appropriations that supplied funding to the\nCustoms Service and the Post Offce were not time limited.\nSupra, at 433\u2013434. The associations resist the analogy to\nthe Post Offce and other fee-based agencies, arguing that\nsuch agencies do not enjoy the same level of fscal independ-\nence as the Bureau. Fee-based agencies, the associations\nreason, \u201ccould not demand funds from the federal fsc, but\nrather needed to persuade the people they served to pay\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthem, and the public could refuse to purchase to infuence\ntheir conduct.\u201d Brief for Respondents 35. The associa-\ntions, however, make no attempt to explain why the possibil-\nity that the public's choices could restrain fee-based agencies'\nrevenue is relevant to the question whether a law complies\nwith the constitutional imperative that there be an\nappropriation.\n                                C\n   Finally, the associations contend that the Bureau's funding\nmechanism provides a blueprint for destroying the separa-\ntion of powers, and that it invites tyranny by allowing the\nExecutive to operate free of any meaningful fscal check. If\nthe Bureau's funding mechanism is consistent with the Ap-\npropriations Clause, the associations reason, then Congress\ncould do the same for any\u2014or every\u2014civilian executive\nagency. And that, they conclude, would be the very unifca-\ntion of the sword and purse that the Appropriations Clause\nforbids.\n\f438 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v.

OF AMERICA, LTD\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   The associations err by reducing the power of the purse to\nonly the principle expressed in the Appropriations Clause.\nTo be sure, the Appropriations Clause presupposes Con-\ngress' powers over the purse. But, its phrasing and location\nin the Constitution make clear that it is not itself the source\nof those powers. The Appropriations Clause is phrased as\na limitation: \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury,\nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d Art.\nI, \u00a7 9. And, it is placed within a section of other such limita-\ntions. Compare ibid. (\u201cNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto\nLaw shall be passed\u201d) and ibid. (\u201cNo Tax or Duty shall be\nlaid on Articles exported from any State\u201d), with \u00a7 8 (\u201cThe\nCongress shall have Power To . . . \u201d). The associations offer\nno defensible argument that the Appropriations Clause re-\nquires more than a law that authorizes the disbursement of\nspecifed funds for identifed purposes. Without such a the-\nory, the associations' Appropriations Clause challenge must\nfail. See Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.

The dissent accepts\nthat the question in this case is ultimately about the meaning\nof \u201cAppropriations.\u201d Post, at 452. It faults us for consult-\ning dictionaries to ascertain the original public meaning of\nthat word, insisting instead that \u201cAppropriations\u201d is a \u201cterm\nof art whose meaning has been feshed out by centuries of\nhistory.\u201d Ibid. But, as we have explained at length, both\npreratifcation and postratifcation appropriations practice\nsupport our source-and-purpose understanding. Supra, at\n427\u2013434. What is more, the dissent never offers a compet-\ning understanding of what the word \u201cAppropriations\u201d means.\nAfter winding its way through English, Colonial, and early\nAmerican history about the struggle for popular control of\nthe purse, the dissent declares that \u201cthe Appropriations\nClause demands legislative control over the source and dis-\nposition of the money used to fnance Government operations\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

The dissent never connects its\nsummary of history back to the word \u201cAppropriations.\u201d\nAnd, even setting that problem aside, it is unclear why the\ndissent's theory leads to a different outcome: Congress con-\ntrols the \u201csource and disposition of the money used to fnance\nGovernment operations and projects\u201d by enacting a law that\nidentifes the source of public funds and authorizes the ex-\npenditure of those funds for designated purposes.\n   The dissent's rendition of history largely ignores the his-\ntorical evidence that bears most directly on the meaning of\n\u201cAppropriations\u201d at the founding\u2014preratifcation appropria-\ntions laws. For example, the dissent spends pages recount-\ning how Parliament secured fscal supremacy and wielded\nthat power to superintend the King. See post, at 453\u2013458.\nAlthough that history is a helpful starting point, see supra,\nat 427\u2013428, it at most explains why appropriations must be\n\u201cmade by Law\u201d\u2014not what it means for the legislature to\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nmake an \u201cAppropriation.\u201d The dissent does not meaning-\nfully grapple with the many parliamentary appropriations\nlaws that preserved a broad range of fscal discretion for the\nKing. See supra, at 428\u2013430. It makes no attempt to ex-\nplain \u201csums not exceeding\u201d appropriations. See ibid. And,\nthe dissent brushes aside the civil list, asserting that it\n\u201c `presented a constitutional problem in the confict between\nthe principle of the independence of the Crown and the prin-\nciple of parliamentary control of fnance.' \u201d Post, at 458\n(quoting Reitan 320). The problem was that the King\nclaimed absolute power to use the sums granted in the civil\nlist as he pleased and regularly spent in excess of the allotted\namount. See id., at 320, 324\u2013329. But, the dissent never\nexplains why the reforms that Parliament adopted in re-\nsponse to these abuses bear on whether the law establishing\nthe civil list was an \u201cappropriation.\u201d\n   The dissent's treatment of early American history does not\nadvance its point either. It highlights the undisputed point\nthat colonial and state legislative bodies exercised the\n\f440 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN.

The dissent quibbles with the open-\nended appropriations laws that we rely on, speculating that\nstate constitutions somehow constrained the breadth of those\nlaws. Post, at 463, n. 13. But, the dissent never explains\nhow these constitutional provisions informed what it meant\nfor state legislative bodies to make an \u201cappropriation\u201d and,\nin any event, its critique misses the point: It was common-\nplace for preratifcation appropriations laws to be open-\nended in a way that is not consistent with the specifcity that\nthe dissent's theory appears to require.\n   When the dissent turns to postratifcation history, it en-\ngages with several appropriations laws enacted by the First\nCongress. The dissent acknowledges, as it must, that the\nfee- and commission-based funding schemes for the Customs\nService and Post Offce show that Congress exercised broad\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndiscretion over how to appropriate money. Post, at 461\u2013462.\nTo square these funding schemes with its understanding of\nthe Appropriations Clause, the dissent points out that Con-\ngress required \u201cfees in excess of what was needed to defray\nthe cost of providing services be turned over to the Treas-\nury.\u201d Post, at 462. This requirement, the dissent reasons,\n\u201censured that Congress maintained control over the pur-\nposes for which [the appropriated] money was spent.\u201d Ibid.\nBut, if what matters is that Congress controls how funds are\nspent, then we are all in agreement\u2014appropriations must\ndesignate the purposes for which money can be spent.\n   Even under the dissent's \u201clegislative control\u201d theory, its\nattempt to distinguish the Customs Service and the Post Of-\nfce from the Bureau is not convincing. The dissent points\nout that Congress had control over the Customs Service, for\ninstance, because Customs had a \u201ccarefully delineated mis-\nsion\u201d and \u201cearly tariff Acts spelled out in excruciating detail\nthe various fees\u201d customs offcers could collect, as well as the\nsalaries the offcers could be paid from those receipts.

According to the dissent, the Bureau is different be-\ncause \u201c[i]ts powers are broad and vast,\u201d \u201c[i]t does not collect\nfees,\u201d and \u201cit is permitted to keep and invest surplus funds.\u201d\nIbid. But, it is unclear why these differences matter under\nthe dissent's theory. After all, to make a valid appropria-\ntion, Congress must designate the objects for which the ap-\npropriated funds may be used\u2014as it did here. See 12\nU. S. C. \u00a7 5497(c)(1). Although there may be other constitu-\ntional checks on Congress' authority to create and fund an\nadministrative agency, specifying the source and purpose is\nall the control the Appropriations Clause requires.\n\n                                V\n  The statute that authorizes the Bureau to draw money\nfrom the combined earnings of the Federal Reserve System\nto carry out its duties satisfes the Appropriations Clause.\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\npeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Sotomayor, Jus-\ntice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett join, concurring.\n   I join in full the Court's opinion holding that the funding\nmechanism for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\ncomplies with the Appropriations Clause. As the Court de-\ntails, that conclusion emerges from the Clause's \u201ctext, the his-\ntory against which that text was enacted, and congressional\npractice immediately following ratifcation.\u201d Ante, at 426.\nAt its inception, the Clause required only that Congress\n\u201cidentify a source of public funds and authorize the expendi-\nture of those funds for designated purposes.\u201d Ibid.

And here just such a tradition supports everything\nthe Court says about the Appropriations Clause's meaning.\nThe founding-era practice that the Court relates became the\n19th-century practice, which became the 20th-century prac-\ntice, which became today's. For over 200 years now, Con-\ngress has exercised broad discretion in crafting appropria-\ntions. Sometimes it has authorized the expenditure of a\nsum certain for an itemized purpose on an annual basis.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nAnd sometimes it has departed from that model in one or\nmore ways. All the fexibility and diversity evident in the\nfounding period has thus continued unabated, making it ever\nmore obvious that the CFPB's funding accords with the\nConstitution.\n   For one thing, Congress has never thought it necessary to\ndesignate specifc amounts for specifc items. Over the\nyears, many appropriations have instead given the Execu-\ntive leeway to decide how to allocate funds, up to a ceiling,\namong a set of activities. As the Court shows, the First\nCongress made appropriations of \u201csums not exceeding \u201d\nstated amounts for \u201cbroad categories\u201d of purposes; the Exec-\nutive then decided the level of funding it would use for all\nthings within a category.

The CFPB's authority to take and allocate mon-\neys up to a statutory cap is just one more instance to add to\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthe list.\n   Similarly, Congress has never thought appropriations\nmust be annual, or even time-limited.

And the growth has not stopped: By Fis-\ncal Year 2022, spending that does not require periodic appro-\npriations (whether annual or longer) accounted for nearly\ntwo-thirds of the federal budget. See Congressional Budget\nOffce, The Accuracy of CBO's Budget Projections for Fiscal\nYear 2022, p. 3 (Jan. 2023). Frequently, too, standing ap-\npropriations do not designate specifc sums of money, thus\ncombining one type of fexibility with another.

So again, Congress's\nnon-time-limited grant to the CFPB for amounts (up to a\ncap) \u201creasonably necessary to carry out\u201d its duties falls\nwithin an established tradition. 12 U. S.

There, Congress's adoption of assessment-\nbased funding mechanisms (similar to those the First Con-\ngress used for the Customs Service and Post Offce, see\nsupra, at 443) has meant that regulators do not have to seek\nyearly legislative funding. And they generally may devote\nthe funds they collect to any of a range of activities. For\nexample, the Offce of the Comptroller of the Currency has\nauthority to levy assessments on banks as \u201cnecessary or ap-\npropriate to carry out [its] responsibilities.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 16;\nsee also Act of Feb. 19, 1875, ch. 89, 18 Stat. 329.

Indeed, not a single federal bank regulator\nis currently, or has been for a long while, funded by standard\ncongressional appropriations. The CFPB received from\nthose regulators most of the powers it wields today. So it\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

As the Court describes, the Appropriations Clause's text\nand founding-era history support the constitutionality of the\nCFPB's funding. See ante, at 426. And so too does a con-\ntinuing tradition. Throughout our history, Congress has\ncreated a variety of mechanisms to pay for government oper-\nations. Some schemes specifed amounts to go to designated\nitems; others left greater discretion to the Executive. Some\nwere limited in duration; others were permanent. Some re-\nlied on general Treasury moneys; others designated alterna-\ntive sources of funds. Whether or not the CFPB's mecha-\nnism has an exact replica, its essentials are nothing new.\nAnd it was devised more than two centuries into an unbro-\nken congressional practice, beginning at the beginning, of\ninnovation and adaptation in appropriating funds. The way\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nour Government has actually worked, over our entire experi-\nence, thus provides another reason to uphold Congress's deci-\nsion about how to fund the CFPB.\n\n  Justice Jackson, concurring.\n   Today, the Court correctly concludes that, based on the\nplain meaning of the text of the Appropriations Clause, \u201can\nappropriation is simply a law that authorizes expenditures\nfrom a specifed source of public money for designated pur-\nposes.\u201d Ante, at 424. The statute that Congress passed to\nfund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau easily meets\nthe Appropriations Clause's minimal requirements. See\nante, at 435. It authorizes the Bureau to withdraw money\nfrom \u201cthe combined earnings of the Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem,\u201d 12 U. S.

When\nthe Constitution's text does not provide a limit to a coordi-\nnate branch's power, we should not lightly assume that Arti-\ncle III implicitly directs the Judiciary to fnd one. The Con-\nstitution was \u201cintended to endure for ages to come, and,\nconsequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819)\n(emphasis deleted). An essential aspect of the Constitu-\ntion's endurance is that it empowers the political branches to\naddress new challenges by enacting new laws and policies\u2014\nwithout undue interference by courts. To that end, we have\nmade clear in cases too numerous to count that nothing in the\nConstitution gives federal courts \u201c `some amorphous general\nsupervision of the operations of government.' \u201d Raines v.\nByrd, 521 U.

Put another way, the principle of separation of pow-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ners manifested in the Constitution's text applies with just as\nmuch force to the Judiciary as it does to Congress and the\nExecutive. See Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75,\n90\u201391 (1947).\n   This case illustrates why. As the Court explains, in re-\nsponse to the devastation wrought by the 2008 fnancial cri-\nsis, Congress passed and the President signed the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nSee ante, at 421. In that statute, Congress chose to fund the\nBureau outside of the annual appropriations process. See\nante, at 422.

As the\nGovernment acknowledges, \u201cMoney . . . drawn from the\nTreasury\u201d is synonymous with the term \u201cpublic Money,\u201d 6\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nwhich appears in the Statement and Account Clause. And\nin this case, it is undisputed that the funds requisitioned by\nthe CFPB constitute \u201cpublic Money.\u201d 7 Thus, the only re-\nmaining textual question is whether the CFPB gets its fund-\ning from \u201cAppropriations\u201d in the sense in which the Consti-\ntution uses that term.\n    The Court answers that question by consulting a few old\ndictionaries, which it says establish that \u201c[i]n ordinary usage,\n. . . an appropriation of public money would be a law author-\nizing the expenditure of particular funds for specifed ends.\u201d\nAnte, at 427. It accordingly concludes that the Appropria-\ntions Clause requires no more than a law, a fund, and a pur-\npose.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 281\u2013306 (2d ed. 1766). Consequently,\nthere was little meaningful difference \u201cbetween the national\nrevenue and the king's private pocket-money.\u201d Maitland\n433.\n   The Crown's fnancial independence gave it the ability to\ngovern with little parliamentary interference. As Maitland\nputs it, \u201cthroughout the Middle Ages the king's revenue had\nbeen in a very true sense the king's revenue, and parliament\nhad but seldom attempted to give him orders as to what he\nshould do with it.\u201d Id., at 309. \u201cUnder the Tudors, parlia-\nment hardly dared to meddle with such matters.\u201d Ibid.\n   In the 17th century, however, this pattern began to change.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nId., at 309\u2013310. By that time, \u201cthe king's ordinary revenues\nwere no longer even remotely suffcient to cover the normal\ncosts of royal governance,\u201d and the heavy expenditures of\nJames I and Charles I exacerbated the problem. J. Chafetz,\nCongress's Constitution 47 (2017) (Chafetz). Rather than\nseeking appropriations from Parliament, the early Stuart\nkings engaged in controversial efforts to obtain additional\nordinary income through the use of various royal \u201cpreroga-\ntive[s].\u201d G.

Among other things, they uni-\nlaterally imposed duties on imports, stepped up the collec-\ntion of feudal dues, sold monopolies, and forced individuals\nto loan money on pain of imprisonment. See id., at 315, 318.\n   These measures aroused opposition and, in any event, did\nnot yield suffcient funds. As a result, James I and Charles\nI periodically found it necessary to ask Parliament to impose\nnew taxes in order to obtain the funds they wanted. When\nthey did so, the Commons began to fex the power of the\npurse and to demand a measure of royal accountability. Dis-\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U.

In 1621, the\npower of the purse played a central role in disputes between\nthe Crown and Parliament over religious, geopolitical, and\njudicial authority. For some months, Parliament ignored re-\nquests from James I for more tax revenue. T. Taswell-\nLangmead, English Constitutional History From the Teu-\ntonic Conquest to the Present Time 532 (3d ed. 1886)\n(Taswell-Langmead). Though Parliament fnally expressed\n\u201cwilling[ness] to grant a moderate subsidy,\u201d it insisted \u201cfrst\u201d\non redress for \u201cgrievances.\u201d Id., at 533; see also Smith 315\u2013\n316.

At the begin-\nning of his reign, the Commons refused to grant him the\nlife-time power to impose tonnage and poundage duties, i. e.,\nduties on imports and exports, as had been the custom, but\ninstead granted the power for only one year. Id., at 539.\nThe members of Commons \u201chad no intention of refusing a\nfurther supply, but were resolved to avail themselves of their\nConstitutional right to make it dependent upon redress of\ngrievances.\u201d Ibid. Indignant about this temerity, the King\nhastily dissolved Parliament before the Lords passed the bill.\nId., at 540; Smith 318. But as a consequence, the King once\nagain then found himself without suffcient funds. So he\ntook matters into his own hands by resorting to the mon-\narchy's \u201cold illegal methods of raising money.\u201d Taswell-\nLangmead 543.\n   This reignited a power struggle between the two\nbranches. As a result, when Charles I again turned to Par-\nliament in 1628, the Commons refused to grant funds until\nhe agreed to the Petition of Right, which demanded that he\n\f456 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v.

I., c. 1. (1628). The\nKing, of course, did not like this. So when the Commons\ncontinued to challenge royal prerogatives, Charles I pro-\nrogued Parliament. And during the long period that ensued\nin which Parliament did not meet (1629\u20131640), the King\nsought new sources of \u201cordinary income,\u201d including the impo-\nsition of \u201cShip-money,\u201d that is, fees imposed on both mari-\ntime and inland counties to pay for the construction of ships.\nTaswell-Langmead 566\u2013569.

During\nthe Commonwealth, the Commons exercised \u201ccomplete au-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthority . . . over the whole receipts and expenditure of the\nnational treasury.\u201d Taswell-Langmead 626. But shortly\nafter the Restoration, the war for the supremacy of the purse\nreignited.

In\nthat commission's very frst report, it recommended that\n\u201c[r]evenue should come from the Pocket of the Subject di-\nrectly into the Exchequer.\u201d Report Relative to the Bal-\nances in the Hands of the Receivers General of the Land\nTax, Nov. 27, 1780 (First Report), reprinted in 1 Reports of\nthe Commissioners Appointed To Examine, Take, and State\nthe Public Accounts of the Kingdom 14 (W. Molleson ed.\n1783). Permitting revenue departments to retain or divert\nany public funds, the Commissioners concluded, would create\na \u201cprivate Interest . . . in direct Opposition to that of the\nPublic.\u201d Ibid. Finally, Parliament took an increasingly\n\u201cfrmer line . . . against virement, that is, the transfer of\n\f458 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN.

The Court notes that after\nthe Revolution of 1688, \u201cParliament's usual practice was to\nappropriate government revenue `to particular purposes\nmore or less narrowly defned,' \u201d and \u201cParliament began lim-\niting the duration of its revenue grants.\u201d Ante, at 428 (quot-\ning Maitland 433). \u201c `Every year,' \u201d the Court continues, the\nKing and his ministers \u201c `had to come, cap in hand, to the\nHouse of Commons, and more often than not the Commons\ndrove a bargain and exacted a quid pro quo in return for\nsupply.' \u201d Ante, at 429 (quoting G. Trevelyan, The English\nRevolution of 1688\u20131689, pp. 180\u2013181 (1939)).\n   In an effort to fnd a trace of helpful precedent in pre-\nfounding British constitutional history, the Court turns to\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nlaws appropriating funds for the \u201ccivil list,\u201d which it touts\nas a particularly \u201cnotable exception\u201d to the centuries-long\nunderstanding of appropriations. Ante, at 429, 432, 439. In\ntruth, however, Parliament's treatment of the civil list actu-\nally undermines the Court's position. The civil list, al-\nthough renamed in 2012, remains to this day, and it consists\nof the money needed to cover the expenses of the royal fam-\nily.9 By the end of the 17th century, \u201cthe Civil List was a\nrelatively small share of the total public expenditure,\u201d but\nthe independence it afforded the Crown \u201cpresented a consti-\ntutional problem in the confict between the principle of the\nindependence of the Crown and the principle of parlia-\nmentary control of fnance.\u201d E.

Id., at 328\u2013337. Begin-\nning in 1760, Parliament enacted a series of laws that altered\nthe appropriation of civil list funds. Id., at 324; see, e.g.,\n1 H. Cavendish, Debates of the House of Commons 267\u2013307\n(1841).

Although the Constitution does not re-\nquire that appropriations be limited to a single year, that\nwas the dominant practice in the years immediately follow-\ning the adoption of the Constitution. See ante, at 432. And\nwhile the frst few appropriations laws were brief and lacked\ndetails about how the money was to be spent, the amounts\napproved closely tracked the estimates submitted by Secre-\ntary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. See Chafetz\n58\u201359. Indeed, the second appropriations act expressly in-\ncorporated the estimates of specifc expenses contained in\nHamilton's report to Congress.

As a result, Congress clearly contemplated that\nthe money would be devoted toward particular purposes.\n   In the mid-1790s, appropriations laws became even more\nspecifc. Chafetz 59. And when Thomas Jefferson became\nPresident, he urged Congress \u201cto multiply barriers against\u201d\nthe \u201cdissipation\u201d of public funds by \u201cappropriating specifc\nsums to every specifc purpose susceptible of defnition,\u201d and\n\u201cby disallowing applications of money varying from the ap-\npropriation in object, or transcending it in amount.\u201d First\nAnnual Message (Dec. 8, 1801), reprinted in 9 The Works of\nThomas Jefferson 336 (P.

Adams ed. 1879)\n(\u201cCongress should adopt such measures as will effectually\nguard against misapplication of public moneys\u201d).\n   To be sure, not all early funding laws followed the domi-\nnant model of specifed short-term appropriations. Agen-\ncies that provided services to a particular segment of the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\npublic were funded by fees that were paid by the recipients\nof those services. See, e. g., Act of Feb. 20, 1792, \u00a7\u00a7 2\u20133, 1\nStat. 233\u2013234 (funding the Post Offce through collection of\npostage rates); Act of Apr. 2, 1792, ch. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 14, 1 Stat. 246,\n249 (funding the National Mint in part through collection of\nfees); Act of July 31, 1789, \u00a7 29, 1 Stat. 44\u201345 (funding cus-\ntoms collection through tonnage fees). If these fees ex-\nceeded the costs of providing the services, however, these\nagencies were required to send the surplus to the Treasury,\nwhich oversaw the collection and use of such fees.10\n   10\n      At the founding, it was well understood that \u201cthe unexpended balance\nof any appropriation after a given period passes to the surplus fund.\u201d 16\nAnnals of Cong. 393 (1807) (statement of Rep. David Thomas). See, e. g.,\nAct of Feb. 11, 1791, ch. 6, 1 Stat. 190 (recognizing default rule that surplus\nfunds return to the Treasury); see also Act of Feb. 20, 1792, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u20134, 1 Stat.\n234 (requiring the Postmaster General to \u201cpay, quarterly, into the treasury\nof the United States, the balance\u201d of any receipts after using them to\n\u201cdefray the expense\u201d of services provided); Act of July 31, 1789, \u00a7 38, 1\n\f462 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v.

Parrillo, Against\nthe Proft Motive 65 (2013) (Parrillo),11 and was presumably\nbased on the idea that the cost of providing certain services\nshould be borne by the recipients of those services rather\nthan the general public. At the same time, the requirement\nthat fees in excess of what was needed to defray the cost of\nproviding services be turned over to the Treasury ensured\nthat Congress maintained control over the ways in which\nthis money was spent. Under these arrangements, there-\nfore, Congress exercised close control over both the amount\nof money that the agencies in question obtained and the way\nin which that money was used. The agencies received and\nwere allowed to use the amount of money necessary to pro-\nvide their narrowly prescribed services. All the rest was\nsent to the Treasury and could then be used only as author-\nized by a congressional appropriation.\n\nPage Proof Pending\n              2    Publication\n   In discussing this early American history, the Court be-\ngins by essentially conceding the principal lesson outlined\nabove. As the Court candidly puts it, \u201c `[w]hen called upon\nto grant supplies,' the lower houses in the colonial assemblies\n`insisted upon appropriating them in detail.' \u201d Ante, at 430.12\nThe best the Court can muster to support its assertion that\n\u201cstate legislative bodies often opted for open-ended, discre-\ntionary appropriations\u201d are a few minor state laws that,\nwhen understood in relation to the Constitutions of the\n\nStat. 48 (providing that an unexpended portion of all customs and fnes\nshall be \u201cpaid into the treasury\u201d thereof); Act of Sept. 2, 1789, ch. 12, \u00a7 2,\n1 Stat. 65 (\u201c[I]t shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to . . .\nsuperintend the collection of the revenue\u201d).\n   11\n      Parliament and \u201cnearly all the American colonial legislatures\u201d used\nsuch fees \u201cto cover many and sometimes all of the offces within their\nrespective bounds.\u201d Parrillo 65.\n   12\n      Many sources document this general approach.

Ibid.13\n                        *    *     *\n  In sum, centuries of historical practice show that the Ap-\npropriations Clause demands legislative control over the\nsource and disposition of the money used to fnance Govern-\nment operations and projects.14\n\n  13\n      Citing two Massachusetts laws directing that certain revenue be used\nfor broadly defned purposes, the Court infers that the executive enjoyed\nwide discretion to decide how this money would be spent, see ante, at 430,\nbut this inference is unwarranted. One of the two Massachusetts laws\ncited by the Court, Act of Nov. 17, 1786, 1786 Mass. Acts and Laws ch. 47,\np. 117, clearly illustrates this point. That law stated expressly that the\nrevenue in question was to be paid \u201cinto the Treasury of this Common-\nwealth, for the exigencies of Government.\u201d Ibid. Under the State Con-\nstitution, this money could be not be taken from the treasury without the\napproval of the legislature. See Mass. Const. of 1780, ch. 2, \u00a7 1, Art. XI.\nAnd to fortify legislative control, the state treasurer was elected annually\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nby the legislature. Id., ch. 2, \u00a7 4.\n   As another supposed example of a state law giving the executive wide\ndiscretion to decide how funds could be spent, the Court cites a Maryland\nlaw specifying that certain revenue was to be used for the general purpose\nof defending the Chesapeake Bay and protecting trade. 1783 Md. Acts\nch. 26, \u00a7 5, reprinted in 1 W. Kilty, The Laws of Maryland (1799). The\nCourt overlooks the fact that under the State's Constitution, the two state\ntreasurers were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the legislature,\nMaryland Constitution of 1776, Art. XIII, and the legislature was specif-\ncally authorized to \u201cexamine and pass all accounts of the State, relating\neither to the collection or expenditure of the revenue, or appoint auditors,\nto state and adjust the same,\u201d Art. X.\n   Finally, the Court points to a Virginia law, ante, at 430, but again the\nCourt overlooks the structure of the Virginia government. Under the\nVirginia Constitution of 1776, the treasurer was elected annually by the\nlegislature, and this obviously gave the legislature extensive power over\nexpenditures. Virginia Constitution of 1776, \u00b617; see Chafetz 55 (refer-\nring to the Virginia Legislature's authority over the state treasurer as an\n\u201cexplicit mechanism of legislative control over appropriations\u201d).\n   14\n      Not content to rest on the Court's argument, which relies on the\nCourt's understanding of the original meaning of the Appropriations\nClause, four Justices advance an entirely different rationale, namely, that\ncongressional practice in the ensuing centuries supports the constitution-\n\f464 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v.

As we said in Seila Law, \u201c `[p]er-\nhaps the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional\nproblem' with an executive entity `is [a] lack of historical\nprecedent' to support it.\u201d 591 U. S., at 220 (quoting Free\nEnterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBd., 561 U. S. 477, 505 (2010)). And the Government agrees\nwith this principle. In its briefng and at argument, the\nGovernment admitted that an utterly unprecedented funding\nscheme would raise a serious constitutional problem. Reply\nBrief 18; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, 26. The Government therefore\nattempts to show that there is ample precedent for the\nCFPB scheme, but that effort fails.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n   The CFPB's funding scheme contains the following fea-\ntures: (1) it applies in perpetuity; (2) the CFPB has discre-\ntion to select the amount of funding that it receives, up to a\nstatutory cap; (3) the funds taken by the CFPB come from\nother entities; (4) those entities are self-funded corporations\nthat obtain their funding from fees on private parties, \u201cnot\ndepartments of the Government,\u201d Emergency Fleet Corp.,\n275 U. S., at 426; (5) the CFPB is not required to return un-\n\nality of the CFPB's scheme. Ante, at 441 (Kagan, J., concurring). This\nargument is doubly fawed. First, the concurrence cannot point to any\nother law that created a funding scheme like the CFPB's. Second, as\nexplained by Justice Scalia, the separation of powers mandated by the\nConstitution cannot be altered by a course of practice at odds with our\nnational charter. See NLRB v.

As noted, funding Government agencies\nwith fees charged to the benefciaries of their services has\nlong been viewed as consistent with the appropriations re-\nquirement. And both the Post Offce and the Customs Serv-\nice fell comfortably into that category.\n   A quick look at the laws that set up the Post Offce and\nthe Customs Service shows that they were nothing like the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nCFPB. In the Act establishing the Post Offce, Congress\ngave that agency a narrow and specifc mission: to \u201cprovide\nfor carrying the mail of the United States.\u201d See, e. g., Act\nof Feb. 20, 1792, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. 234. The Postmaster's discre-\ntionary authority was modest. (He could, for example, de-\ncide whether mail should be carried on particular routes \u201cby\nstage carriages or horses.\u201d Ibid.) The Act specifed in min-\nute detail the fees that could be collected from those who\nused the Post Offce's services. \u00a7 9, id., at 235. And it re-\nquired the Postmaster \u201cto render to the secretary of the\ntreasury, a quarterly account of all the receipts and expendi-\ntures\u201d and to \u201cpay quarterly, into the treasury . . . , the bal-\nance in his hands.\u201d \u00a7 4, id., at 234. Under this arrange-\nment, Congress controlled the amount that the Post Offce\ntook in (i. e., the sum total of the fees specifed by law) and\nhow those fees were to be spent (i. e., to provide for carrying\nthe mail).\n   Much the same is true with respect to the Customs Serv-\nice, which the Government claims \u201cbest\u201d resembles the\n\f466 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v.

Like the Post Offce, the Cus-\ntoms Service had a carefully delineated mission\u2014basically,\nto control imports and exports, and to collect duties and\nother payments from those engaged in those activities. To\nmaintain accountability, the early tariff Acts spelled out in\nexcruciating detail the various fees, fnes, and forfeitures\nthat offcers were to collect, as well as the salaries and com-\nmissions that were to be paid out of those receipts. Act of\nJuly 31, 1789, ch. 5, 1 Stat. 29\u201349; L. Schmeckebier, The Cus-\ntoms Service: Its History, Activities and Organization 3\u20136\n(1924). Surplus funds had to be sent to the Treasury, Act of\nJuly 31, 1789, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 38, 1 Stat. 38, 48, and for many years,\nthese funds were the lifeblood of the Federal Government.\nFrom 1789 to 1862, \u201c[n]early all of federal revenue was de-\nrived from customs duties.\u201d A.

It enjoys substantial discre-\ntionary authority. It does not collect fees from persons and\nentities to which it provides services or persons and entities\nthat are subject to its authority. And it is permitted to keep\nand invest surplus funds. In short, the Government's \u201cbest\u201d\nargument fails.\n   The Government's next-best analogs fare no better. Mov-\ning to modern agencies, the Government claims that the\nCFPB's funding scheme is not materially different from the\nfunding schemes of a list of other currently existing agencies.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 22\u201323, 29\u201336 (comparing the CFPB\nto the Offce of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National\n  15\n    \u201cIn 1792, for example, customs duties . . . accounted for $3.4 million of\nthe $3.7 million of total government receipts.\u201d Founding Choices: Ameri-\ncan Economic Policy in the 1790s, p. 101 (D.

Our decision in Seila Law ad-\ndressed part of the problem posed by this arrangement. It\nmade the CFPB accountable to the President, but that deci-\nsion did nothing to protect Congress's power of the purse.\nIndeed, standing alone, Seila Law worsens the appropria-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntions problem. The appropriations requirement developed\nto ensure that the Executive (in England, the monarch)\nwould be accountable to the people's elected representatives.\n  16\n     The Government also suggested that the Federal Reserve Board is a\nclose historical analog for the CFPB. Brief for Petitioners 23; Tr. of Oral\nArg. 41. But that setup should not be seen as a model for other Govern-\nment bodies. The Board, which is funded by the earnings of the Federal\nReserve Banks, 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 243, 244, is a unique institution with a unique\nhistorical background. It includes the creation and demise of the First\nand Second Banks of the United States, as well as the string of fnancial\npanics (in 1873, 1893, and 1907) that were widely attributed to the coun-\ntry's lack of a national bank. See generally O. Sprague, History of Crises\nUnder the National Banking System, S. Doc. No. 538, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.\n(1910). The structure adopted in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 repre-\nsented an intensely-bargained compromise between two insistent and in-\nfuential camps: those who wanted a largely private system, and those who\nfavored a Government-controlled national bank. See, e. g., R. Lowenstein,\nAmerica's Bank 5\u20138, 113\u2013116, 265 (2015). For Appropriations Clause pur-\nposes, the funding of the Federal Reserve Board should be regarded as a\nspecial arrangement sanctioned by history.\n\f468 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD.\n                   Alito, J., dissenting\n\nSeila Law, however, increased the power of the Executive\nover appropriations. By brandishing or wielding the threat\nof removal, a President may push the CFPB director to req-\nuisition the amount of money that the President thinks is\nappropriate and to spend that money as the President\nwishes. I joined the decision in Seila Law and continue to\nbelieve that it was correctly decided, but it solved only half\nthe accountability problem that inheres in the CFPB's\nstructure.\n                              B\n   Left with no analog in history, the Government employs a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy to defend the CFPB's funding\nscheme. It argues that even if no prior agency had a fund-\ning scheme with all the features of the CFPB's, the funding\nschemes of other presumptively constitutional agencies con-\ntain one or more of the features found in the CFPB's scheme.\nIt then reasons that the combination of these features in the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nCFPB's scheme must be constitutional as well.\n   This argument founders for two reasons. First, the\nCFPB's scheme includes an important feature never before\nseen. As explained, the CFPB's money does not come from\nCongress, from private recipients of its services, or from pri-\nvate entities that it regulates. It does not even originate\nwith another Government agency. Instead, the CFPB gets\nits money via a three-step process: The Federal Reserve\nBanks earn money from the purchase and sale of securities,\nas well as from the fees they charge for providing services\nto depository institutions. The Federal Reserve Banks\nthen deliver these earnings to the Federal Reserve System.\nFinally, the CFPB requests an amount from the Federal Re-\nserve Board. That feature of the CFPB scheme is entirely\nnew.\n   Second, the Government's argument fails \u201cto engage with\nthe Dodd-Frank Act as a whole.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U. S., at\n230. By addressing the individual elements of the CFPB's\nsetup one-by-one, the Government seeks to divert attention\n\f                   Cite as: 601 U. S. 416 (2024)            469\n\n                       Alito, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the combined layers that insulate the CFPB from ac-\ncountability to Congress. Elements that are safe or tolera-\nble in isolation may be unsafe when combined. In the case\nof the CFPB, the combination is deadly. The whole point of\nthe appropriations requirement is to protect \u201cthe right of\nthe people,\u201d through their elected representatives in Con-\ngress, to \u201cbe actually consulted\u201d about the expenditure of\npublic money. St. George Tucker, View of the Constitution\nof the United States 297 (1803) (C. Wilson ed. 1999). The\nCFPB's design strips the people of this power.\n   The Federal Reserve's earnings represent \u201cspecific\ncharges for specifc services to specifc individuals or compa-\nnies.\u201d FPC v. New England Power Co., 415 U. S. 345, 349\n(1974). It would be \u201ca sharp break with our traditions\u201d to\nallow the CFPB to use these earnings to fund a broader\narray of governmental activities that have little-to-no rela-\ntionship with those specifc charges, services, and regulated\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nentities. National Cable Television Assn., Inc. v. United\nStates, 415 U. S. 336, 341 (1974). By allowing the CFPB to\nuse the Federal Reserve's earnings to enforce and implement\nbroader consumer protection laws, Congress impermissibly\nremoved the CFPB \u201cfrom its customary orbit\u201d as an agency,\nauthorizing the Bureau to appropriate funds obtained from\nprivate sources \u201cin the manner of an Appropriations Com-\nmittee.\u201d Ibid. In other words, Congress abdicated its ap-\npropriations authority, an exclusively legislative prerogative.\nKnote v. United States, 95 U. S. 149, 156 (1877). But Con-\ngress lacks the authority to \u201ctransfer to another branch pow-\ners which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\u201d Gundy\nv. United States, 588 U. S. 128, 135 (2019) (plurality opinion)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In sum, the CFPB's unprecedented combination of funding\nfeatures affords it the very kind of fnancial independence\nthat the Appropriations Clause was designed to prevent. It\nis not an exaggeration to say that the CFPB enjoys a degree\nof fnancial autonomy that a Stuart king would envy.\n\f470 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU v. COMMU-\n     NITY FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSN. OF AMERICA, LTD.\n                   Alito, J., dissenting\n\n                                   C\n   This autonomy has real-world consequences. The CFPB\nis a powerful agency with the authority to impose \u201csubstan-\ntive rules [on] a wide swath of industries\u201d and \u201clev[y] knee-\nbuckling penalties against private citizens.\u201d Seila Law, 591\nU. S., at 222, n. 8. In the last several months alone, the Bu-\nreau has announced plans to effectuate not one, but three\nmajor changes in consumer protection law. The CFPB has\nissued guidance cautioning fnancial institutions from \u201cdeny-\ning credit to individuals based on their [illegal] immigration\nstatus, regardless of their personal circumstances and dem-\nonstrated ability to repay.\u201d 17 It has also begun \u201ca rule-\nmaking process to remove medical bills from Americans'\ncredit reports\u201d 18 and to cap overdraft fees \u201cat an established\nbenchmark\u2014as low as $3.\u201d 19 These may or may not be wise\npolicies, but Congress did not specifcally authorize any of\nthem, and if the CFPB's fnancing scheme is sustained, Con-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ngress cannot control or monitor the CFPB's use of funds to\nimplement such changes. That is precisely what the Appro-\npriations Clause was meant to prevent.\n\n                            *      *     *\n  The Court holds that the Appropriations Clause is satisfed\nby any law that authorizes the Executive to take any amount\nof money from any source for any period of time for any\nlawful purpose.

There are times\nwhen it is our duty to say simply that a law that blatantly\nattempts to circumvent the Constitution goes too far. This\nis such a case.

At any rate, since the\ndecision below relied on both the Appropriations Clause and broad separa-\ntion of powers principles, 51 F. 4th 616, 635 (CA5 2022), it is not clear why\nthe Court does not proceed to apply those principles.\n\f                           Reporter\u2019s Note\n\n  The attached opinion has been revised to refect the usual publication\nand citation style of the United States Reports.
