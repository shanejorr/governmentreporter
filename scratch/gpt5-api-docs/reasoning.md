Reasoning models
================

Explore advanced reasoning and problem-solving models.

**Reasoning models** like [GPT-5](/docs/models/gpt-5) are LLMs trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning. Reasoning models [think before they answer](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning for agentic workflows. They're also the best models for [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), our lightweight coding agent.

We provide smaller, faster models (`gpt-5-mini` and `gpt-5-nano`) that are less expensive per token. The larger model (`gpt-5`) is slower and more expensive but often generates better responses for complex tasks and broad domains.

Get started with reasoning
--------------------------

Reasoning models can be used through the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses/create) as seen here.

Using a reasoning model in the Responses API

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    reasoning: { effort: "medium" },
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "input": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with format \"[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\" and prints the transpose in the same format."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

In the example above, the `reasoning.effort` parameter guides the model on how many reasoning tokens to generate before creating a response to the prompt.

Specify `low`, `medium`, or `high` for this parameter, where `low` favors speed and economical token usage, and `high` favors more complete reasoning. The default value is `medium`, which is a balance between speed and reasoning accuracy.

How reasoning works
-------------------

Reasoning models introduce **reasoning tokens** in addition to input and output tokens. The models use these reasoning tokens to "think," breaking down the prompt and considering multiple approaches to generating a response. After generating reasoning tokens, the model produces an answer as visible completion tokens and discards the reasoning tokens from its context.

Here is an example of a multi-step conversation between a user and an assistant. Input and output tokens from each step are carried over, while reasoning tokens are discarded.

![Reasoning tokens aren't retained in context](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/context-window.png)

While reasoning tokens are not visible via the API, they still occupy space in the model's context window and are billed as [output tokens](https://openai.com/api/pricing).

### Managing the context window

It's important to ensure there's enough space in the context window for reasoning tokens when creating responses. Depending on the problem's complexity, the models may generate anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of reasoning tokens. The exact number of reasoning tokens used is visible in the [usage object of the response object](/docs/api-reference/responses/object), under `output_tokens_details`:

```json
{
    "usage": {
        "input_tokens": 75,
        "input_tokens_details": {
            "cached_tokens": 0
        },
        "output_tokens": 1186,
        "output_tokens_details": {
            "reasoning_tokens": 1024
        },
        "total_tokens": 1261
    }
}
```

Context window lengths are found on the [model reference page](/docs/models), and will differ across model snapshots.

### Controlling costs

If you're managing context manually across model turns, you can discard older reasoning items _unless_ you're responding to a function call, in which case you must include all reasoning items between the function call and the last user message.

To manage costs with reasoning models, you can limit the total number of tokens the model generates (including both reasoning and final output tokens) by using the [`max_output_tokens`](/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-max_output_tokens) parameter.

### Allocating space for reasoning

If the generated tokens reach the context window limit or the `max_output_tokens` value you've set, you'll receive a response with a `status` of `incomplete` and `incomplete_details` with `reason` set to `max_output_tokens`. This might occur before any visible output tokens are produced, meaning you could incur costs for input and reasoning tokens without receiving a visible response.

To prevent this, ensure there's sufficient space in the context window or adjust the `max_output_tokens` value to a higher number. OpenAI recommends reserving at least 25,000 tokens for reasoning and outputs when you start experimenting with these models. As you become familiar with the number of reasoning tokens your prompts require, you can adjust this buffer accordingly.

Handling incomplete responses

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    reasoning: { effort: "medium" },
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 300,
});

if (
    response.status === "incomplete" &&
    response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens"
) {
    console.log("Ran out of tokens");
    if (response.output_text?.length > 0) {
        console.log("Partial output:", response.output_text);
    } else {
        console.log("Ran out of tokens during reasoning");
    }
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt
        }
    ],
    max_output_tokens=300,
)

if response.status == "incomplete" and response.incomplete_details.reason == "max_output_tokens":
    print("Ran out of tokens")
    if response.output_text:
        print("Partial output:", response.output_text)
    else:
        print("Ran out of tokens during reasoning")
```

### Keeping reasoning items in context

When doing [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling) with a reasoning model in the [Responses API](/docs/apit-reference/responses), we highly recommend you pass back any reasoning items returned with the last function call (in addition to the output of your function). If the model calls multiple functions consecutively, you should pass back all reasoning items, function call items, and function call output items, since the last `user` message. This allows the model to continue its reasoning process to produce better results in the most token-efficient manner.

The simplest way to do this is to pass in all reasoning items from a previous response into the next one. Our systems will smartly ignore any reasoning items that aren't relevant to your functions, and only retain those in context that are relevant. You can pass reasoning items from previous responses either using the `previous_response_id` parameter, or by manually passing in all the [output](/docs/api-reference/responses/object#responses/object-output) items from a past response into the [input](/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-input) of a new one.

For advanced use cases where you might be truncating and optimizing parts of the context window before passing them on to the next response, just ensure all items between the last user message and your function call output are passed into the next response untouched. This will ensure that the model has all the context it needs.

Check out [this guide](/docs/guides/conversation-state) to learn more about manual context management.

### Encrypted reasoning items

When using the Responses API in a stateless mode (either with `store` set to `false`, or when an organization is enrolled in zero data retention), you must still retain reasoning items across conversation turns using the techniques described above. But in order to have reasoning items that can be sent with subsequent API requests, each of your API requests must have `reasoning.encrypted_content` in the `include` parameter of API requests, like so:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o4-mini",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "input": "What is the weather like today?",
    "tools": [ ... function config here ... ],
    "include": [ "reasoning.encrypted_content" ]
  }'
```

Any reasoning items in the `output` array will now have an `encrypted_content` property, which will contain encrypted reasoning tokens that can be passed along with future conversation turns.

Reasoning summaries
-------------------

While we don't expose the raw reasoning tokens emitted by the model, you can view a summary of the model's reasoning using the the `summary` parameter. See our [model documentation](/docs/models) to check which reasoning models support summaries.

Different models support different reasoning summary settings. For example, our computer use model supports the `concise` summarizer, while o4-mini supports `detailed`. To access the most detailed summarizer available for a model, set the value of this parameter to `auto`. `auto` will be equivalent to `detailed` for most reasoning models today, but there may be more granular settings in the future.

Reasoning summary output is part of the `summary` array in the `reasoning` [output item](/docs/api-reference/responses/object#responses/object-output). This output will not be included unless you explicitly opt in to including reasoning summaries.

The example below shows how to make an API request that includes a reasoning summary.

Include a reasoning summary with the API response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: "What is the capital of France?",
  reasoning: {
    effort: "low",
    summary: "auto",
  },
});

console.log(response.output);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="What is the capital of France?",
    reasoning={
        "effort": "low",
        "summary": "auto"
    }
)

print(response.output)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "input": "What is the capital of France?",
    "reasoning": {
        "effort": "low",
        "summary": "auto"
    }
  }'
```

This API request will return an output array with both an assistant message and a summary of the model's reasoning in generating that response.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "rs_6876cf02e0bc8192b74af0fb64b715ff06fa2fcced15a5ac",
        "type": "reasoning",
        "summary": [
            {
                "type": "summary_text",
                "text": "**Answering a simple question**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a straightforward question: the capital of France is Paris. It\u2019s a well-known fact, and I want to keep it brief and to the point. Paris is known for its history, art, and culture, so it might be nice to add just a hint of that charm. But mostly, I\u2019ll aim to focus on delivering a clear and direct answer, ensuring the user gets what they\u2019re looking for without any extra fluff."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "msg_6876cf054f58819284ecc1058131305506fa2fcced15a5ac",
        "type": "message",
        "status": "completed",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "annotations": [],
                "logprobs": [],
                "text": "The capital of France is Paris."
            }
        ],
        "role": "assistant"
    }
]
```

Before using summarizers with our latest reasoning models, you may need to complete [organization verification](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) to ensure safe deployment. Get started with verification on the [platform settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general).

Advice on prompting
-------------------

There are some differences to consider when prompting a reasoning model. Reasoning models provide better results on tasks with only high-level guidance, while GPT models often benefit from very precise instructions.

*   A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker—you can give them a goal to achieve and trust them to work out the details.
*   A GPT model is like a junior coworker—they'll perform best with explicit instructions to create a specific output.

For more information on best practices when using reasoning models, [refer to this guide](/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices).

### Prompt examples

Coding (refactoring)

OpenAI o-series models are able to implement complex algorithms and produce code. This prompt asks o1 to refactor a React component based on some specific criteria.

Refactor code

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Instructions:
- Given the React component below, change it so that nonfiction books have red
  text.
- Return only the code in your reply
- Do not include any additional formatting, such as markdown code blocks
- For formatting, use four space tabs, and do not allow any lines of code to
  exceed 80 columns

const books = [
  { title: 'Dune', category: 'fiction', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Frankenstein', category: 'fiction', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Moneyball', category: 'nonfiction', id: 3 },
];

export default function BookList() {
  const listItems = books.map(book =>
    <li>
      {book.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
`.trim();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Instructions:
- Given the React component below, change it so that nonfiction books have red
  text.
- Return only the code in your reply
- Do not include any additional formatting, such as markdown code blocks
- For formatting, use four space tabs, and do not allow any lines of code to
  exceed 80 columns

const books = [
  { title: 'Dune', category: 'fiction', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Frankenstein', category: 'fiction', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Moneyball', category: 'nonfiction', id: 3 },
];

export default function BookList() {
  const listItems = books.map(book =>
    <li>
      {book.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Coding (planning)

OpenAI o-series models are also adept in creating multi-step plans. This example prompt asks o1 to create a filesystem structure for a full solution, along with Python code that implements the desired use case.

Plan and create a Python project

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
I want to build a Python app that takes user questions and looks
them up in a database where they are mapped to answers. If there
is close match, it retrieves the matched answer. If there isn't,
it asks the user to provide an answer and stores the
question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory
structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply
your reasoning at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
`.trim();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
I want to build a Python app that takes user questions and looks
them up in a database where they are mapped to answers. If there
is close match, it retrieves the matched answer. If there isn't,
it asks the user to provide an answer and stores the
question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory
structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply
your reasoning at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

STEM Research

OpenAI o-series models have shown excellent performance in STEM research. Prompts asking for support of basic research tasks should show strong results.

Ask questions related to basic scientific research

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
What are three compounds we should consider investigating to
advance research into new antibiotics? Why should we consider
them?
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
What are three compounds we should consider investigating to
advance research into new antibiotics? Why should we consider
them?
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Reasoning best practices
========================

Learn when to use reasoning models and how they compare to GPT models.

OpenAI offers two types of models: [reasoning models](/docs/models#o4-mini) (o3 and o4-mini, for example) and [GPT models](/docs/models#gpt-4.1) (like GPT-4.1). These model families behave differently.

This guide covers:

1.  The difference between our reasoning and non-reasoning GPT models
2.  When to use our reasoning models
3.  How to prompt reasoning models effectively

Read more about [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning) and how they work.

Reasoning models vs. GPT models
-------------------------------

Compared to GPT models, our o-series models excel at different tasks and require different prompts. One model family isn't better than the other—they're just different.

We trained our o-series models (“the planners”) to think longer and harder about complex tasks, making them effective at strategizing, planning solutions to complex problems, and making decisions based on large volumes of ambiguous information. These models can also execute tasks with high accuracy and precision, making them ideal for domains that would otherwise require a human expert—like math, science, engineering, financial services, and legal services.

On the other hand, our lower-latency, more cost-efficient GPT models (“the workhorses”) are designed for straightforward execution. An application might use o-series models to plan out the strategy to solve a problem, and use GPT models to execute specific tasks, particularly when speed and cost are more important than perfect accuracy.

### How to choose

What's most important for your use case?

*   **Speed and cost** → GPT models are faster and tend to cost less
*   **Executing well defined tasks** → GPT models handle explicitly defined tasks well
*   **Accuracy and reliability** → o-series models are reliable decision makers
*   **Complex problem-solving** → o-series models work through ambiguity and complexity

If speed and cost are the most important factors when completing your tasks _and_ your use case is made up of straightforward, well defined tasks, then our GPT models are the best fit for you. However, if accuracy and reliability are the most important factors _and_ you have a very complex, multistep problem to solve, our o-series models are likely right for you.

Most AI workflows will use a combination of both models—o-series for agentic planning and decision-making, GPT series for task execution.

![GPT models pair well with o-series models](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/customer-service-example.png)

_Our GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models triage order details with customer information, identify the order issues and the return policy, and then feed all of these data points into o3-mini to make the final decision about the viability of the return based on policy._

When to use our reasoning models
--------------------------------

Here are a few patterns of successful usage that we’ve observed from customers and internally at OpenAI. This isn't a comprehensive review of all possible use cases but, rather, some practical guidance for testing our o-series models.

[Ready to use a reasoning model? Skip to the quickstart →](/docs/guides/reasoning)

### 1\. Navigating ambiguous tasks

Reasoning models are particularly good at taking limited information or disparate pieces of information and with a simple prompt, understanding the user’s intent and handling any gaps in the instructions. In fact, reasoning models will often ask clarifying questions before making uneducated guesses or attempting to fill information gaps.

> “o1’s reasoning capabilities enable our multi-agent platform Matrix to produce exhaustive, well-formatted, and detailed responses when processing complex documents. For example, o1 enabled Matrix to easily identify baskets available under the restricted payments capacity in a credit agreement, with a basic prompt. No former models are as performant. o1 yielded stronger results on 52% of complex prompts on dense Credit Agreements compared to other models.”
>
> —[Hebbia](https://www.hebbia.com/), AI knowledge platform company for legal and finance

### 2\. Finding a needle in a haystack

When you’re passing large amounts of unstructured information, reasoning models are great at understanding and pulling out only the most relevant information to answer a question.

> "To analyze a company's acquisition, o1 reviewed dozens of company documents—like contracts and leases—to find any tricky conditions that might affect the deal. The model was tasked with flagging key terms and in doing so, identified a crucial "change of control" provision in the footnotes: if the company was sold, it would have to pay off a $75 million loan immediately. o1's extreme attention to detail enables our AI agents to support finance professionals by identifying mission-critical information."
>
> —[Endex](https://endex.ai/), AI financial intelligence platform

### 3\. Finding relationships and nuance across a large dataset

We’ve found that reasoning models are particularly good at reasoning over complex documents that have hundreds of pages of dense, unstructured information—things like legal contracts, financial statements, and insurance claims. The models are particularly strong at drawing parallels between documents and making decisions based on unspoken truths represented in the data.

> “Tax research requires synthesizing multiple documents to produce a final, cogent answer. We swapped GPT-4o for o1 and found that o1 was much better at reasoning over the interplay between documents to reach logical conclusions that were not evident in any one single document. As a result, we saw a 4x improvement in end-to-end performance by switching to o1—incredible.”
>
> —[Blue J](https://www.bluej.com/), AI platform for tax research

Reasoning models are also skilled at reasoning over nuanced policies and rules, and applying them to the task at hand in order to reach a reasonable conclusion.

> "In financial analyses, analysts often tackle complex scenarios around shareholder equity and need to understand the relevant legal intricacies. We tested about 10 models from different providers with a challenging but common question: how does a fundraise affect existing shareholders, especially when they exercise their anti-dilution privileges? This required reasoning through pre- and post-money valuations and dealing with circular dilution loops—something top financial analysts would spend 20-30 minutes to figure out. We found that o1 and o3-mini can do this flawlessly! The models even produced a clear calculation table showing the impact on a $100k shareholder."
>
> –[BlueFlame AI](https://www.blueflame.ai/), AI platform for investment management

### 4\. Multistep agentic planning

Reasoning models are critical to agentic planning and strategy development. We’ve seen success when a reasoning model is used as “the planner,” producing a detailed, multistep solution to a problem and then selecting and assigning the right GPT model (“the doer”) for each step, based on whether high intelligence or low latency is most important.

> “We use o1 as the planner in our agent infrastructure, letting it orchestrate other models in the workflow to complete a multistep task. We find o1 is really good at selecting data types and breaking down big questions into smaller chunks, enabling other models to focus on execution.”
>
> —[Argon AI](https://argon-ai.com/), AI knowledge platform for the pharmaceutical industry

> “o1 powers many of our agentic workflows at Lindy, our AI assistant for work. The model uses function calling to pull information from your calendar or email and then can automatically help you schedule meetings, send emails, and manage other parts of your day-to-day tasks. We switched all of our agentic steps that used to cause issues to o1 and observing our agents becoming basically flawless overnight!”
>
> —[Lindy.AI](http://Lindy.AI), AI assistant for work

### 5\. Visual reasoning

As of today, o1 is the only reasoning model that supports vision capabilities. What sets it apart from GPT-4o is that o1 can grasp even the most challenging visuals, like charts and tables with ambiguous structure or photos with poor image quality.

> “We automate risk and compliance reviews for millions of products online, including luxury jewelry dupes, endangered species, and controlled substances. GPT-4o reached 50% accuracy on our hardest image classification tasks. o1 achieved an impressive 88% accuracy without any modifications to our pipeline.”

From our own internal testing, we’ve seen that o1 can identify fixtures and materials from highly detailed architectural drawings to generate a comprehensive bill of materials. One of the most surprising things we observed was that o1 can draw parallels across different images by taking a legend on one page of the architectural drawings and correctly applying it across another page without explicit instructions. Below you can see that, for the 4x4 PT wood posts, o1 recognized that "PT" stands for pressure treated based on the legend.

### 6\. Reviewing, debugging, and improving code quality

Reasoning models are particularly effective at reviewing and improving large amounts of code, often running code reviews in the background given the models’ higher latency.

> “We deliver automated AI Code Reviews on platforms like GitHub and GitLab. While code review process is not inherently latency-sensitive, it does require understanding the code diffs across multiple files. This is where o1 really shines—it's able to reliably detect minor changes to a codebase that could be missed by a human reviewer. We were able to increase product conversion rates by 3x after switching to o-series models.”

While GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini may be better designed for writing code with their lower latency, we’ve also seen o3-mini spike on code production for use cases that are slightly less latency-sensitive.

> “o3-mini consistently produces high-quality, conclusive code, and very frequently arrives at the correct solution when the problem is well-defined, even for very challenging coding tasks. While other models may only be useful for small-scale, quick code iterations, o3-mini excels at planning and executing complex software design systems.”

### 7\. Evaluation and benchmarking for other model responses

We’ve also seen reasoning models do well in benchmarking and evaluating other model responses. Data validation is important for ensuring dataset quality and reliability, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare. Traditional validation methods use predefined rules and patterns, but advanced models like o1 and o3-mini can understand context and reason about data for a more flexible and intelligent approach to validation.

> "Many customers use LLM-as-a-judge as part of their eval process in Braintrust. For example, a healthcare company might summarize patient questions using a workhorse model like gpt-4o, then assess the summary quality with o1. One Braintrust customer saw the F1 score of a judge go from 0.12 with 4o to 0.74 with o1! In these use cases, they’ve found o1’s reasoning to be a game-changer in finding nuanced differences in completions, for the hardest and most complex grading tasks."

How to prompt reasoning models effectively
------------------------------------------

These models perform best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance (and can sometimes hinder it). See best practices below, or [get started with prompt examples](/docs/guides/reasoning/advice-on-prompting#prompt-examples).

*   **Developer messages are the new system messages**: Starting with `o1-2024-12-17`, reasoning models support developer messages rather than system messages, to align with the chain of command behavior described in the [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#follow-the-chain-of-command).
*   **Keep prompts simple and direct**: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions.
*   **Avoid chain-of-thought prompts**: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
*   **Use delimiters for clarity**: Use delimiters like markdown, XML tags, and section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
*   **Try zero shot first, then few shot if needed**: Reasoning models often don't need few-shot examples to produce good results, so try to write prompts without examples first. If you have more complex requirements for your desired output, it may help to include a few examples of inputs and desired outputs in your prompt. Just ensure that the examples align very closely with your prompt instructions, as discrepancies between the two may produce poor results.
*   **Provide specific guidelines**: If there are ways you explicitly want to constrain the model's response (like "propose a solution with a budget under $500"), explicitly outline those constraints in the prompt.
*   **Be very specific about your end goal**: In your instructions, try to give very specific parameters for a successful response, and encourage the model to keep reasoning and iterating until it matches your success criteria.
*   **Markdown formatting**: Starting with `o1-2024-12-17`, reasoning models in the API will avoid generating responses with markdown formatting. To signal to the model when you do want markdown formatting in the response, include the string `Formatting re-enabled` on the first line of your developer message.

How to keep costs low and accuracy high
---------------------------------------

With the introduction of `o3` and `o4-mini` models, persisted reasoning items in the Responses API are treated differently. Previously (for `o1`, `o3-mini`, `o1-mini` and `o1-preview`), reasoning items were always ignored in follow‑up API requests, even if they were included in the input items of the requests. With `o3` and `o4-mini`, some reasoning items adjacent to function calls are included in the model’s context to help improve model performance while using the least amount of reasoning tokens.

For the best results with this change, we recommend using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) with the `store` parameter set to `true`, and passing in all reasoning items from previous requests (either using `previous_response_id`, or by taking all the output items from an older request and passing them in as input items for a new one). OpenAI will automatically include any relevant reasoning items in the model's context and ignore any irrelevant ones. In more advanced use‑cases where you’d like to manage what goes into the model's context more precisely, we recommend that you at least include all reasoning items between the latest function call and the previous user message. Doing this will ensure that the model doesn’t have to restart its reasoning when you respond to a function call, resulting in better function‑calling performance and lower overall token usage.

If you’re using the Chat Completions API, reasoning items are never included in the context of the model. This is because Chat Completions is a stateless API. This will result in slightly degraded model performance and greater reasoning token usage in complex agentic cases involving many function calls. In instances where complex multiple function calling is not involved, there should be no degradation in performance regardless of the API being used.
